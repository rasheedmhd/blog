        <h1>In The Eyes of The Beholder</h1>

        <h3>Frame of Reference</h3>
        <p>
          Frame of Reference: Your perspective(Physics). If everything but the
          speed of light can appear different based of the observers frame of
          reference, taking frame of reference into consideration always is a
          powerful way to deal with situations.
        </p>

        <h3>Framing</h3>
        <p>
          How you present a situation to someone's perspective. When you are
          presenting you want frame it in a way that the is intuitive for the
          observer to understand. You present it based on their perspective.
          Others will frame you when presenting ideas. it is important to take a
          step back and take a holistic look at the situation and see how it can
          be presented/framed. Multiple framing can be valid offer wildly
          different perspectives of the underlying situation.
        </p>

        <h3>Nudging</h3>
        <p>
          Subtly influence someone in a certain direction/choice through
          (visual) cues. Think of what call to action(CTA) buttons do on a
          website. Highlighted - in whatever form - menu items in an eatery
        </p>

        <h3>Anchoring</h3>
        <p>
          The tendency to rely too heavily on first impressions. I first learnt
          of anchoring from Chris Do, of thefutur.com. He gave an example in how
          to price brand identity products/projects. Instead of waiting for the
          customer to say their budget, you first mention your price is mention
          a price way higher than what you actually take. Your customer will
          tend to use your price as a mark to negotiate against, rather than
          mentioning an arbitrary number if they went first. - and link - The
          books example is even better.
        </p>

        <h3>Availability Bias</h3>
        <p>
          When recently received information skews your objective view. It stems
          from over relying on recent occurrences rather than taking a big big
          picture overview of the available data. When you frame of reference it
          fixed on recent occurrences, you are implicitly nudged on to
          availability bias and that skews you objective views on the
          situations.
        </p>

        <h3>Filter Bubble</h3>
        <p>
          A situation were you are put in "bubble" of what big tech thinks you
          like. The name is derived from the fact that someone/some entity makes
          decisions on what they think you like and dislike or is indifferent
          about and filters out the dislikes letting you only see what you like
        </p>

        <h3>Echo Chambers</h3>
        <p>
          A collection of filter bubbles where the same ideas seems to be
          bouncing off entities. Like a group of people believing the same
          things and disliking the same things. At the onset they might not hold
          same ideas in unison but as time goes back, the effect of the echo
          chamber, is that they end up believing in the same thing more and more
