        <h1>Get Started with Bug Bounty Programs</h1>
        <h3>Where to hack: Social Websites</h3>
        <p>
          Because of how large they tend to be, there is a huge possibility for
          bugs to exists. They are not only huge but complex as they have to
          handle thousands of interactions between entities of the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Easily found web vulnerabilities includes, IDOR (Insecure direct object
          references), data leaks, accounts takeover. Without input validation,
          you can catch XSS(Cross side scripting), SQL Injection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vickie suggest starting with Social Sites as a beginner. Why? 1. A
          Large attack surface(All the parts of the app that you an hack. The
          program usually designates part of their product that bounty hackers
          are allowed to hack also called in scope. There parts not allowed are
          called out of scope and it is illegal to hack out of scope areas). 2.
          A large surface area means a wide variety of bugs to discover. 3. And
          2 means that there is a great opportunity to learn a lot of web
          vulnerabilities quickly.
        </p>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>You will need to learn how to use a proxy like Burp Proxy</p>
        <p>
          Common web vulnerabilities like what was mentioned above already,
          Javascript, and some web development knowledge
        </p>

        <p>
          CONS: Higher competition as everyone is looking for same
          vulns(vulnerabilities) on them
        </p>

        <h3>Where to hack: General Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Sites that offer user - server interactions. Not user - user as in
          social website above. Doesn't offer a large surface area compared to
          social websites, means you have to be looking at attacking the
          platforms stack so you need to understand server side vulns, use a
          proxy and have web dev and programming know how
        </p>

        <h3>Where to hack: Mobile Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Good enough a hacker? how about specialise? here you go. Requires
          skills learnt from Web hacking and new skills like certificate pinning
          by pass, mobile reverse engineering, cryptography
        </p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Dedicated mobile device, one with root access, simulators</p>
        <h3>Where to hack: Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)</h3>
        <p>Check common API vulns like data leaks and injection flaws</p>
        <h3>Where to hack: Source Code Executables</h3>
        <p>
          Programming + Debugging Skills, web vulns, tools, reverse engineering,
          cryptography, code analysis, software dev skills. Harder to do means
          less hackers sniffing for bugs, relatively.
        </p>

        <h3>Where to hack: Hardware/IOT</h3>
        <p>Hacking Cars, Smart TV, Thermostats etc</p>
        <p>
          Common IOT vulns, web vulns, hardware vulns, cryptography, reverse
          engineering, programming + debugging, wireless networks
