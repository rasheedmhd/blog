        <h1>On Choosing Bug Bounty Programs.</h1>

        <h3>Choosing Bug bounty Programs</h3>
        <p> vulns = vulnerabilities</p>
        <p>Scopes: Asset v Vuln scope</p>
        <p>Payout Amounts</p>
        <p>Response Times</p>
        <h3>Getting private invites</h3>
        <p>Submit vulns hacked in public programs</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Learn to escalate them to high impact</p>
        <p>Do CTF's on Hackerone</p>
        <p>Don't spam</p>
        <p>Respectful effective communication</p>
        <p>
          There is competition. Be the Remora fish, what the big sharks, pass,
          you clean that up. Low Pay, low hanging fruit programs. Vulns
          disclosure Programs, first. Big guys, no! no! go yes! small guy. Go
          for fast response times for avoid frustration. Consider company
          reputation, will they help you learn? Will they pay you?
        </p>

        <h3>Make a bug bounty company program table to compare</h3>

        <h3>Good Report Writing</h3>
        <p>1. Craft a descriptive title</p>
        <p>2. Provide a clear summary</p>
        <p>
          3. Include a severity assessment. see
          <a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/8475343-severity"
            >Hacherone's</a
          >,
          <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy/"
            >Bugcrowd's</a
          >, <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">first.org</a>
        </p>
        <p>4. Give clear and concise steps to reproduce</p>
        <p>5. Provide a proof of concept</p>
        <p>6. Describe the impact and attack scenarios</p>
        <p>7. Recommend possible mitigations</p>
        <p>8. Validate the report</p>

        <h3>Understanding Why you are failing</h3>
        <h3>Not finding bugs</h3>
        <p>1. You participate in the wrong programs</p>
        <p>
          2. You don't stick to a program; You keep moving from one program to
          another without spending significant time on any.
        </p>
        <p>3. You don't Recon</p>
        <p>4. You focus on only low hanging fruits; be clever</p>
        <p>You don't get into private programs; get more points</p>
        <h3>Why your reports don't get to triage</h3>
        <p>You don't read the program policy</p>
        <p>
          You Don't Put Yourself in the Organization's Shoes; helps you know the
          kind of vulns they prioritize so you can hurt for those
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't chain bugs: Learn to turn informative/low severity bugs into
          bigger vulns by chaining them
        </p>
        <p>
          You write bad, Reports; this is just a terrible thing to do, don't do
          it.
        </p>
        <p>Duplicates? it is what it is; you can help yourself though</p>
        <h3>What to Do When You're Stuck</h3>
        <p>1. Take a break; Hammock-Driven hacking</p>
        <p>2. Build your hacking skills, while you rest/take a break</p>
        <p>3. Gain a fresh perspective; taking breaks will help in that.</p>
