		<h1> 2022 and beyond - Dreams and Aspirations </h1>

		<p>
			It is a brand new day. A brand new opportunity to make something great
		</p>

		<p>
			Every single day I wake up with the intentions of contemplating and making the best long term strategic decisions that I can make.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like to admire the present but I hardly expect anything to happen quickly. Those expectations will quickly drain your motivation. I have studied a lot of history about the most relevant companies of today and one thing that always cut across is that the founders usually work on the ideas for at least a decade and acquired skills within the past decade that lead to their current successes. 
		</p>

		<p>
			That’s why it is important for me at this age to make very clear, consistent and strategic decisions of my life since I am very young and trying to achieve the best I can in my short life on this planet.
		</p>

		<p>
			I started my entrepreneurial journey by learning how to code and building startups to ran them myself because I never wanted to work for anyone. None of them really worked though. I tried building, Trendz - social media platform that had dislike button. Vlick a virtual reality oriented social media platform. Yapaala.com an all-in-one room renting platform. Hammerfy.com A kind of wayfair.com for Ghanaians.
		</p>

		<p>
			I teamed up with a dear friend and a brother to build a crypto company(www.instagram.com/bitperse) to serve the African market but I quickly realised that Ghana was no Silicon Valley. Within the first few months we grew very quickly and just as we Grew, we stumbled quickly and I was back to square zero.
		</p>

        <p>
			In the past decades technically inclined CEOs have been on the rise. Most of the best CEOs in the world are not from a business management background but from engineering. It doesn’t surprise me because engineers do a lot of critical thinking and problem solving and in a world that is constantly changing one can only argue that those are the skills required for outstanding success. 
        </p>

        <p>
			What I am teaching myself now is problem solving and strategic decision making through software development. I made this decision not because I was taught in school or I was directed by a higher up. I dropped out of school so that I could focus on learning the things that mattered to me most and that goes to tell you that I am very opinionated about my decisions in life and yet very flexible to change when I learn new things. I am making this decision from what I have learnt in the past years on the internet about how the world we know today came to be and the direction in which it is going. I definitely want to be at the forefront of technological innovations that change life for the better.
        </p>

		<p>
			I might not have a huge impact on the world Right now like I want to, but every time that I write a line of code, I am imagining that, at this young age if I am able to write software that thousands of people use, what would I build in the next decade?
		</p>

		<p>
			As I end the year, this will be my focus henceforth.
