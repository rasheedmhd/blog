        <h1>What is an Operating System?</h1>
        <p>
          An operating system is any software that runs on kernel mode. The
          operating system provides an abstraction of the hardware to
          application programmers and application programs. The OS also manages
          the resources of the computer, these resources includes printers,
          mice, keywords, processes which are all part of the modern computer.
          It usually serves as the software that controls other software on top
          of it running at user mode.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most modern machines have two modes of operation, the
          <a
            href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/user-mode-and-kernel-mode"
            >Kernel / Supervisor mode and the User Mode.</a
          >
          The OS, which sits right on top of the machineâ€™s hardware interface,
          runs in the kernel mode. This allows it to execute any instruction
          that the machine is capable of. All other programs run in the User
          Mode where some fundamental instructions of the machine are forbidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          I canâ€™t define operating systems without talking about the generations
          of computers. I will list down the generations below but I will only
          write about the Operation Systems from the 4th generation of computers
          as that is the generation of operating system that I intend to build
          through out these write ups.
        </p>

        <h2>Generations of Computing Machines</h2>
        <h3>
          First Generation ( 1945 - 55 ) -
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube">Vacuum Tubes</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Professor John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry built what is now regarded
          as the first
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_computer"
            >functioning digital computer.</a
          >
          It used 300 vacuum tubes. In this generation of computers, all
          programming was done in machine language. Machine language is a lower
          level language than even assembly language. Machine language is
          peculiar to any given machine. That is, two different computing
          machines had two different machine languages, and usually, they were
          not portable. To program any machine, the programmer had to learn its
          specific machine language.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Second Generation ( 1955 - 65 ):
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">Transistors</a>
          and Batch Systems
        </h3>
        <p>
          The invention of the transistor set in the new wave of computers.
          Computers could now be manufactured at a comparatively cheaper price.
          They were slightly more reliable too. They worked for longer periods
          of time. They were sold mainly to institutions such as businesses,
          governments, and universities) to help with number crunching. These
          machines were called mainframes.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Third Generation ( 1965 - 1980 ):
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">ICs</a>
          and Multiprogramming
        </h3>
        <p>
          The IBM 360 was the first major computer line to adopt this tech. It
          was at this generation of computers that Unix was built.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Fourth Generation Personal Computers ( 1980 - Present ):
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer">
            Personal Computers
          </a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The microprocessor chip made it possible for individuals to own
          personal computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1974 Intel built the first
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080"
            >general purpose 8-bit CPU</a
          >
          and wanted an operating system. Gary Kildall was contacted to write
          one. Gary would later take this OS from Intel and create the worldâ€™s
          dominant OS company at the time. Before there was Windows and
          Macintosh.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early 1980â€™s IBM designed the IBM PC. They reached out to Gary
          Kildall considering that he had already written an IOs for the intel
          8080, to write the PCâ€™s operating system but
          <a href="https://bookjelly.com/the-tragic-story-of-gary-kildall/"
            >failed</a
          >
          to make a deal with him. They reached a deal with Bill Gates though,
          who in turn bought an OS from Tim Paterson and the rest is history. [
          This part of the story is very shortened since it is long story on it
          own. ] I would urge the curious reader to look into the story as I
          have provided a link above as a start. In 2016 after learning about
          this, I actually added the story to a book that I was writting at the
          time. The book is lying in a box now 2 rooms away from me as I type
          this. I hope to publish it one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You see in the early days operating systems didnâ€™t have fancy
          graphics, Operations were based on users typing in commands into the
          computer from a hooked keyboard. More like what we call terminal or
          CLI or MS DOS in windows. In the 1960s Doug Engelbert, the inventor of
          the mouse at Stanford Research Institute made a demo later termed the
          mother of all demos. It launched the
          <a href="https://youtu.be/yJDv-zdhzMY">Graphical User Interface</a>
          era.
        </p>
        <p>
          These ideas were incorporated into OS design by researchers at Xerox
          PARC where both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates saw their implementations
          and
          <a href="https://youtu.be/pQocN_c2uLI">copied</a> them into their
          respective OSs. The Windows OS and the Apple Macintosh.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86"> x86 </a></h3>
        <p>
          The OS I am trying to build is going to be based on the x86
          architecture. The x86 architecture refers to all modern processors
          that are based on the instruction set architecture that started with
          the intel 8086 in the 1970s.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several such processes that are been manufactured by
          companies including AMD and Intel, these processes may vary is various
          aspects, they could be 32-bit or 64-bit but fundamentally they are the
          same and code that was written based on the x86 decades ago can still
          work on recent processors.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI">GUI</a></h3>
        <p>
          A few paragraphs above,I mentioned that operating systems used not the
          to have shinny graphics until Doug Engelbert invented the GUI, that
          said the operating system that I am trying to build doesnâ€™t come with
          a GUI.Before GUI the most used formed of UI was a Text UI. A Text UI
          is a User Interface where all the output is in the form of Text. Text
          UI is easy to implement so I will be implementing one for the OS. Most
          Operating Systems derived from Unix support a windowing system called
          the X Window System produced at MIT, this windowing system provides
          basic window management functions. Usually A full GUI like
          <a
            href="https://opensource.com/article/22/6/kde-vs-gnome-linux-desktop"
            >Gnome or KDE</a
          >
          can be run on top of the X Window System. Ubuntu uses Gnome and Unity
          and some Unix Derivatives use KDE. For about 10 years, from 1985 -
          1995, Windows was just a GUI on top of MS-DOS.

          I hope this gives you a better view and understanding of what an OS
          really is and What I am trying to build. Later write ups will give
          more details on my progress.
