        <h1> I am Learning ML but not Machine Learning </h1>

        <h2> ML - Meta Language </h2>

        <p> Is it crazy how if you search ML on Youtube you get only videos on Machine Learning, Machine Learning has shadowed
            Meta Language, the Programming Language. You would only have better luck if you search Standard ML. 
        </p>

        <p> So why am I learning an obscure language? You see ML is the most popular Programming Language that you have never heard of. 
            No, I am not selling you snake oil, it is not like you would buy with bitcoin anyway. 
        </p>

        <p> Who wouldn't want to learn a language that had so much novel ideas in language design that over 40 years later, 
            other Programming Language designers are taking ideas from? That is ML.
        </p>

        <p> Most Programming Languages we use today stem from a few languages, ML is one of those Languages, another is ALGOL. </p>

        <p> That means, even though you might not have heard of ML or given it a second though, you might just be using ML,
            in your favorite language without knowing, because at some point of the design of that language, its designers 
            decided to go with a language feature that was pioneered by ML.
