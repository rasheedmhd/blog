        <h1> I am Learning ML but not Machine Learning </h1>

        <h2> ML - Meta Language </h2>

        <p> Is it crazy how if you search ML on Youtube you get only videos on Machine Learning, Machine Learning has shadowed
            Meta Language, the Programming Language. You would only have better luck if you search Standard ML. 
        </p>

        <p> So why am I learning an obscure language? You see ML is the most popular Programming Language that you have never heard of. 
            No, I am not selling you snake oil, it is not like you would buy with bitcoin anyway. 
        </p>

        <p> Who wouldn't want to learn a language that had so much novel ideas in language design that over 40 years later, 
            other Programming Language designers are taking ideas from? That is ML.
        </p>

        <p> Most Programming Languages we use today stem from a few languages, ML is one of those Languages, another is ALGOL. </p>

        <p> That means, even though you might not have heard of ML or given it a second though, you might just be using ML,
            in your favorite language without knowing, because at some point of the design of that language, its designers 
            decided to go with a language feature that was pioneered by ML.
        </p>

        <p> Heard of the difference of Procedure and Functions been that in a procedure nothing is returned? but in a function
            a value is returned ? Well that is true in ML
        </p>

        <h2> Why Meta ? </h2>
        <p>
            While working on the theorem proving system LCF (short for Logic of Computable Functions), Robin Milner and colleagues in the early 1970s created a language for writing scripts
to create proofs. Since LCF was itself a language for representing formulas in an underlying logic, the theorem proving language was called the Meta Language, or ML for short.
The original ML language soon evolved into a general-purpose programming language. Like
Lisp, it featured first-class functions and pattern matching, and was expression-oriented and
garbage-collected. Unlike Lisp, ML was statically typed, and was the first language to implement the Hindley-Milner type system and its associated type inference mechanism.
        </p>

        <h2> Static Typing </h2>

        <h2> Type Inference </h2>

        <h1> What Rust borrowed from ML </h1>
        <h2> Vectors </h2>
        <h2> Unity - Unit () </h2>

        <h2> Rust Lifetimes and ML any Types</h2>

        <p>
            {born: int, crowned: 'a, died: int, name: 'b, quote: 'c} -> int
Here, 'a, 'b, and 'c are type variables that can be any type, since they are not used in any operations within the function. The fields born and died must be of type int because they are used in the subtraction operation.
