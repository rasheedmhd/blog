        <h1>Us, Purpose and Ambition.</h1>

        <p>My biggest fear, is that I do not fulfil my purpose on earth before I
        vacate this body. The trickier thing is that I am not even so sure of
        what exactly the purpose is. All I have managed to piece up together, so
        far, are basically glimpses of the future that I need to build.</p>
        <p>In the past I have been so much convinced of the certainty of building that
        future but things are no longer that same. Some weeds of doubt have
        managed to grow up amongst my strong believes.</p> 
        
        <p>Above all else what I
        think I do need to do, is believe, even more stronger than I have ever
        believed in my self. A strong believe that I will uncover everything
        that the purpose entails and that I will achieve everything uncovered.
        Within me there are probably a set of 10 different personalities and I
        am the least of our favorite. I am the vessel, the one that keeps us
        all within one and by that I am one the with the limitations.</p>
        
        <p>I am the
        one afraid, I am the one governed by the laws of physics, I am the one
        making up limitations for us, I am the one least achieved, the one
        bugged by all these dreams of greatness yet still a long way to go and
        that is why I am our least favorite.</p>
        
        <p>I am by far the most important
        too, I guess or maybe I try not to see it in terms of importantness but
        as the one tasked with the burden to unify the 10. For without this
        vessel there is not a habitat for these minds to dwell. 
        <p>And this burden
        to contain, to limit because although these minds might hate the
        limitations that I impose, it is important because we know the chaos we
        can unleash on the world if I let them free.</p>
        
        <p>As the main responsibility
        of this vessel is, I will unify, create harmony and allow this vessel of
        difference but in unison to prevail, to succeed within this short period
        of time till when I leave this earth and maybe The Maverick will take
        over. Maybe because I do not know exactly what happens when this body
        expires.</p>
