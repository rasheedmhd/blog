        <h1>How to KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)</h1>
        <p>
          These are notes on the Second sub chapter of chapter 1. Chapter One
        </p>
        <h3>Be a chef</h3>
        <p>
          Someone who can take list of ingredients and cook something amazing
          without looking at a cook book. The model that helps with that is
          thinking/arguing from first principles.
        </p>

        <h3>First principles</h3>
        <p>
          First principles are a group of self-evident assumptions that make up
          the building blocks of your conclusion/solution. If you can argue from
          first principles, you can approach unfamiliar situations or form novel
          ideas to familiar situations. - Thinking from first principles -
          Thinking from the bottom up, using the most basic components to build
          up. - Thinking from first principles helps you understand the problem
          space better, even if you end up agreeing with conventional wisdom
        </p>
        <h3>On When Plans Fail</h3>
        <p>
          Remember when old Mike said "Everybody has a plan until they get
          punched in the mouth"? Yeah, I bet you do, essentially your first plan
          is going to be wrong and may be wildly wrong, you have to plan for
          that as well, except that this time it is not really a plan it should
          be taking real time feedback and adjusting your plan appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>This is calling de-risking.</p>
        <h3>Avoid premature optimization:</h3>
        <p>
          Doing too much more than is necessary to test/de-risk an assumption.
          Why? Because if your assumptions turn out to be wrong, imagine the
          tremendous amount of time wasted.
        </p>
        <h3>Start with an MVP.</h3>
        <p>
          The minimum amount of work you need to do to demonstrate an essential
          part or an idea or product. - Link YC video. Going with an MVP, you
          are able to evaluate your assumptions quickly and adapt to learn
          towards what works and what doesn't.
        </p>
        <h3>Ockham's Razor</h3>
        <p>
          Remember - Ockham's Razor - shave off the complicated and start with
          the simplest of postulates. It hints that when faced is several
          assumptions, the simplest is likely to be true. Why address the
          complicated assumptions when they clearly exists simpler assumptions
          that helps explain the assumption. - link and quote - By starting with
          the simple which is likely to be true, we essentially cut off the
          complicated. Ockham's razor can help with long term decision making
          like who to date. Rather than have a long list of preference in a
          partner, you could cast your mind back to KISS, being wrong less,
          because we care about being wrong less rather than being right? We
          could go back and look for all the things that made our past
          relationships to fail and focus on that in dating the next person.
        </p>

        <h3>Conjunction Fallacy and Overfitting</h3>

        <p>
          Beware of conjunction fallacy and overfitting - in conjunction fallacy
          the probability of two things occurring in conjunction is less than or
          equal to one of the events occurring alone. You are biased to think a
          more specific situation is likely to happen than a generic situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overfitting is using too many assumptions to explain data - inverse of
          Ockham's razor eg using an overly complicated explanation when a
          simple one would do. Happens because we are naturally biased towards
          and and also when we don't take Ockham's razor, unforced errors or
          fall into conjunctive fallacy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ask "how much does my data/situation supports my conclusions versus
          other conclusions", asking this, and using Ockham's razor to
          de-risk/evaluate the situation, you avoid conjunction fallacy and
          overfitting.
        </p>

        <p>All this and this is how you KISS. Keep it Simple Stupid.</p>
