<p>When I took this photo, I was in a meeting as a Software Engineer for [Redacted]. We were working a loan app.</p>

<p>It was a collaboration between my company, MTN, they have a subsidiary call Mobile Money (MoMo) Limited and Bank of Ghana.</p> 

<p>And I was there! 26 year old Garu boy. I have no computer science/engineering background, and you know already, my highest school qualification in WASSCE.</p> 

<p>I only got my first computer in 2017, followed my interest and learnt everything I know about computers/programming on the internet. Youtube videos, books and documentations.</p> 

<p>It was so surreal to me that I just couldn't believe it was happening. What made it even more surreal was the fact that in 2018/19 I had a similar idea that I thought I could build into a company, I even wrote down the idea in a my S6 which I lost and here I was working in a company bringing this into reality. I have this habit of writing down ideas so I don't forget. In fact, right now, I try to write everything that I find interesting about my minds wanders to.</p> 

<p>My monthly salary was GHS7000 net. As I write this I am no longer with the company, in fact I haven't been employed for the past 2 months and I am not looking for a job. I have exhausted all the savings I made from that job too. But I am still not looking for job. I don't think a would derive a lot of joy from working for another company like that. If Hubtel, Fido(I interviewed last year and didn't get in) or turntabl comes knocking, I might reconsider but I am super sure that they won't come lol.</p> 

<p>I am focused on pursuing other interests. More on this later. But boils down to the kind of person that I am. Never afraid to take risks. Understanding very well when I am not longer super interesting in something or I feel like for the long term, the pursuit is not going to help me make the kind of impact I want to have in the world. More on this later. But it is the reason why I stopped spoken word poetry, the reason why I stopped photography and the reason why I moved away from crypto. I will write about this some day.</p> 

<p>I don't know how to write this without it looking like a brag, but I have thought hard about this and I think the message is important to share and the message is, what ever your dreams are, what ever your passions are pursue them relentlessly.</p> 

<p>And as Kwaku Frimpong said, "Find my devil, choke en neck", I hope you find your dreams and choke their necks to never leave you.</p>
