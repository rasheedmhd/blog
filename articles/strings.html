            <h1>
                Understanding Moves through Rust String data type Representation.
            </h1>

            <p>
                I was reading The Rust Programming Language Book, on Chapter 3, titled, Ownership.
                The first part of that chapter talks about understanding Ownership by using the String data type.
            </p>

            <p>
                This writeup is not about teaching you Ownership and Moves. I hope that it gives you an understanding of
                how Rust
                represents complex data structures in memory. This article is supposed to be used as a companion to Rust
                Book on the chapter that teaches Ownership.
            </p>

            <p>
                What led me to writing this article is that, I realized that the Rust Book drawings of how Rust
                represent Strings in memory wasn't clear enough. I took to excalidraw to draw the diagrams in a more
                understandable way with intentions of showing it on Wednesday during our DevCongress Rust Study Group
                meeting. When I was done with the drawing, I realized that understanding how Rust store Strings in
                memory and the need to prevent double frees, gives one an intuitive understanding of Rust move
                semantics. So I set out to write this using my diagrams to explain instead of using The Rust Book's
                drawings
                with hopes that Ownership, Rust Strings and Moves will click for you and you will never have to worry
                about them again. Just hopes, no promises.
            </p>

            <h2>The 3 cardinal Ownership rules</h2>
            <p>
                1. Each Value has an Owner.
                2. Each Value must have only one Owner.
                3. When the owner of a value goes out of Scope, the value is dropped.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are the rules that power Rust's advanced type system. These rules might be simple and easy to
                memorize but understanding the rules and how they provide Rust with memory safety is very important to
                understanding Rust.
            </p>

            <h2> The Borrow Checker </h2>

            <p>
                Sure you must have heard of the Borrow-Checker and how Rust has a steep learning curve.
                The Borrow-Checker will fight you, you will have a lot of compilation issues but once you are able to
                fix the issues and your code compiles, Rust guarantees you that the program will always run without
                memory safety bugs. So the Borrow-Checker gives you upfront pain for more peace during runtime.
            </p>

            <h2> Stack vs Heap </h2>
            <p>
                There are a lot of resources that try to explain Stacks and Heaps, a good example is The Rust Book,
                which I would advise that you read it, if you haven't read it already.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am only going to state a few properties of Stacks and Heaps that are relevant in explaining how Rust
                manages memory for us without Garbage Collection while guaranteeing memory safety.
            </p>

            <h2> Stack </h2>

            <p>
                The Stack is a Last-in First-out data structure. This means that when you put data into the stack, You
                put each data block on top of the prior stacked block, think of packing plates, the ideal way to remove
                the plates is to start removing from the top. You add data to the Stack through a process called push
                and you remove data from the Stack through a process called pop.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Rust, all data that is stored on the Stack is fixed and can be determined during compile time. This
                is very important. In Rust, function arguments, pointers to data allocated on the Heap and the
                function's own local variables are stored on the stack.
            </p>

            <h2> Heap </h2>

            <p>
                The Heap is a growable data structure. When you want to store data on the Heap, you ask the memory
                allocator to allocate a space of memory for you, and it finds a memory space large enough to hold your
                data and marks it as being in use and returns a pointer to the memory. The Heap is slower than the Stack
                because we have to first allocate enough memory, dynamically grow it and also look up data when we need
                it using a pointer.
            </p>

            <h2> The String Rust Data Type </h2>
            <p>
                Is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 Encoded data type, known as a complex data type in Rust. Does the
                growable give you a hint on where it will be stored? Heap Heap Hurra.....
            </p>

            <p>
                Rust has two types of strings, str, known as a string slice, its size is easily determined at compile
                time by just looking at it. It is stored in the program's binary.
                There is another String data type implemented in the std lib. It has an implementation that allows the
                Rust Compiler to drop it when its owner goes out of Scope, freeing memory. This is in contrast to other
                languages like Go that has a Garbage collector to free memory that is no longer in use and C that allows
                the programmer to manually allocate and free memory. Both of which have downsides.
            </p>

            <h2> A Rust String data type is made up of 3 sections. </h2>

            <p>
                1. A pointer to the memory allocated for the string to store its data
                2. Length, the number of bytes that the String data consumes.
                3. Capacity. Before this clicked for me, length and capacity confused me but the difference is very
                simple. The capacity is the total number of bytes allocated for the String's data. That means we can
                have a string data that doesn't use all the bytes that the OS allocates for it, in which case the
                Capacity will be bigger than the length, or we can have the String's data consume all the bytes, in this
                case the length and the capacity are the same. If the allocated memory weren’t dynamically resizable, We
                could have another case where the String's data is bigger than the capacity. But how? Hear me out. We
                already said the String data type is growable. But, how do we grow a String? The String data type has
                methods that we can use to add data to the String instance, essentially growing it.
            </p>

            <div id="code">
                <pre class=”line-numbers”>
                    <code class="language-rust">
                        let mut comm = String::from("Dev");

                        comm.push_str("Congress"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

                        println!("{}", comm); // This will print the string `DevCongress`
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                When we wrote the line above, we got allocated with some memory, of length 3 and capacity 3. Later we
                decided to add "Congress"."DevCongress" can no longer be stored in the first memory we were allocated
                because its capacity was only 3 but now "comm" requires memory of minimum capacity of 11. Now our
                variable "comm" gets allocated with a new memory address, one that has enough capacity to store
                "DevCongress", That is what we call growing a string.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope this gives you a good anatomy of the String data type. An astute reader might ask, so where is
                the string data? In our example above the String's data would be "DevCongress".
                Here is where the Heap comes in, the string data is stored on the heap. This way it can be dynamically
                resized without any problems because that is how the Heap works.
            </p>

            <p>
                Suffice to say, when it comes to String, Rust divides it into 2, Storing the metadata of the String on
                the Stack and the value of the String itself in the heap. This way, we can store the metadata which is
                fixed at compile time on the Stack and the value of the String, which can be dynamically resized during
                runtime is then stored on the heap.
            </p>

            <h2> Rust String Representation </h2>
            <div id="string_diagram">
                <image alt="Rust String Representation" src="../images/string_representation.png"></image>
            </div>

            <p>
                The image above shows everything that I described above so far. I will add in little notes below in
                hopes of clarifying the diagram.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can see ... written below the Stack, Heap texts on both diagrams, and also at the bottom of the
                Heap. They show the directions that more memory can be allocated. In the Stack diagram it shows that
                data can only be added from the above. And in the Heap since memory is allocated randomly, we assume
                that data can be added from above or below, since the space that the value of our variable occupies was
                allocated randomly.
            </p>

            <h2> Understanding Moves </h2>


            <div id="code">
                <pre class=”line-numbers”>
                    <code class="language-rust">
                        let a = 13;
                        let b = a;
                        println!("a: {}, b: {}", a, b); // prints 'a: 13, b: 13'
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                If you compiled this it would run without issues, this works because Rust Scalar data types are
                lightweight, they are fixed sized and don't consume a lot of memory storage. They have a Copy trait
                implementation that allows them to be copied from one variable to the other without any performance
                hits.
            </p>


            <div id="code">
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        let comm = String::from("Rust Study Group");
                        let group = comm;
                        println!("comm: {}, group: {}", comm, group);
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                One would expect the above to work like that, but it doesn't. You see, Strings can be very huge, they
                can be a 3 letter variable like we saw above to as big as a whole dictionary. It would be grossly
                inefficient to copy such huge data from variable to variable. This is why Rust stores Strings are
                explained above.
            </p>

            <p>
                What Rust does above is that, instead of copying the whole String, it copies only the part of the string
                stored on the Stack ( the pointer, the length and the capacity ).
            </p>

            <p>
                So now, both <code id="oneline">comm</code> and <code id="oneline">group</code>, stores the same data.
                They
                point to the same
                memory location. Which
                means they both now own the same value stored on the heap. This violates Ownership rules #2 as stated
                above.
            </p>

            <h2> Enter Move! </h2>

            <p>
                We already violated Ownership rule #2 above, which states that, Each value must have only one Owner.
                Why not violate, #3 while we can? Which also states that, When the Owner of a value goes out of Scope,
                the value is dropped. What happens if our program transitions from the scope of comm and group? comm and
                group should be dropped, as per Ownership rule #3. But now we have 2 variables pointing to the same
                memory. If Rust tried dropping group and <code id="oneline">comm</code>, By the time it tried to drop
                <code id="oneline">comm</code>, <code id="oneline">groud</code> would have been
                dropped already leaving us with what we call double-frees. Double free is definitely a memory bug and as
                Graydon Hoare states, [Memory] Safety is <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/247406.html">Rust's
                    raison d'etre</a>; we need to find a way to solve this problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                How does Rust manage double free errors, in this situation? Move. When we bound <code
                    id="oneline">groud</code> to <code id="oneline">comm</code>, Rust
                made sure to drop <code id="oneline">comm</code>, Making <code id="oneline">group</code> the only owner
                of the
                data stored in the heap. In this way,
                When <code id="oneline">group</code> is dropped later on, there aren't any issues because <code
                    id="oneline">group</code> is the only owner of "Rust
                Study Group".
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the epiphany that led me to this article. Move doesn't need to be taught differently, in fact
                move becomes a design consequence of having memory safety, not a new feature that we need to learn.
            </p>
