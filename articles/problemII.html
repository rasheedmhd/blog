        <h1>On Problem Solving II: Unknown Unknowns: A Repair Story</h1>

        <h2>The Original Plan</h2>
        <p>
            The repair was simple—or at least so I thought.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had two controllers. Both had desirable and non-desirable parts. The goal was straightforward:
            combine the desirable parts from both to form one complete, well-functioning system.
            Frankenstein shit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Opening and separating everything went smoothly—until I reached the combining step.
            That's when reality hit.
        </p>

        <h2>Don't judge a <s>book</s> Controller by its <s>cover</s> case</h2>
        <p>
            The outside of the controllers were identical, but internally they were cast slightly differently.
            Just enough that the parts wouldn't fit together.
        </p>

        <p>
            Back to square zero. Literally.
        </p>

        <p>
            The initial goal never changed, but my proposed solution clearly wouldn't work and had to be discarded.
            I still needed to come up with a different solution to a problem I didn't even know I would face.
        </p>

        <p>
            These were the unknown unknowns.
        </p>

        <h2>Pausing to Re-Think</h2>
        <p>
            I had to pause and really think through my options—play out what was feasible, what wasn't,
            and if something was feasible, what the best way to achieve it would be.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I landed on an idea that actually made sense and decided to pursue it,
            I quickly realized something else:
        </p>

        <p>
            I knew <em>what</em> I wanted to do, but I didn't know exactly <em>how</em> to do it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why I Loved the Process</h2>
        <p>
            This is the part I loved the most.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every single step introduced a problem I hadn't expected at all.
            Each time, I had to think quickly, solve it, and immediately move on to the next challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes that meant literally picking up random things along the way
            and turning them into tools to solve the immediate problem.
        </p>

        <h2>MacGyver was here some!</h2>
        <p>
            At one point, I was looking for a pair of pliers.
            I couldn't remember where I had put them.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I opened drawers, I was thinking to myself,
            <q>I am so screwed if I don't find this plier.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't find it.
        </p>

        <p>
            But instead, I spotted a piece of copper wire.
            I grabbed it instantly, and an idea clicked.
            I could solve the problem I needed the pliers for
            just through a completely different approach.
        </p>

        <h2>The Payoff</h2>
        <p>
            The sheer number of tiny problems I had to fix to reach the final goal
            only made the process more intriguing.
        </p>

        <p>
            By far, this is the best repair I have ever made in my life.
            It reminded me of my curiosity as a kid—opening electronics, tinkering with them,
            and enjoying every bit of it.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
            I'll likely extend this blog in the future, or maybe write a new post
            to add more context.
        </p>

        <p>
            This was originally meant to be a WhatsApp status,
            but I kept typing and typing and eventually thought:
            <q>Hey, put this on the blog.</q>
        </p>

        <h2>A Final Note</h2>
        <p>
            And by the way—this entire blog post was typed on my phone.
            A 6.2″ Samsung S22.
