        <h1>Binary Exploitation Isn't That Hard</h1>

        <p>
          I don't think binary exploitation is <em>that</em> hard. I might be
          biased, but I'm big on interest. If I'm not already intrigued by
          something, it's almost impossible to convince me to care about it. But
          if I <em>am</em> interested, I'll do it no matter how hard it gets —
          and I never get tired of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The landscape has changed a lot. Hackers didn't start with the web. If
          you listen to the OG hackers, you'll hear many of them talk about
          wanting to hack the games they were playing, and that curiosity pulled
          them down the rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why I say binary exploitation isn't that hard compared to web
          hacking. If someone is interested in it, they can start by learning C
          and understanding the compilation pipeline. They might ask, “If
          computers don't understand the language I wrote, why do I have to
          write this?” Then they realize: programmers before them used to code
          in
          <strong>binary</strong>, then moved to assembly, and eventually to
          this high-level thing we know as C.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, they can explore compilation. They can look at the
          assembly generated from their C code, inspect object files, pull up
          CPU architecture documentation, and start picking things up. They can
          begin with something basic like a buffer overflow, intentionally write
          buggy code, crash their system, and learn how to fix it.
        </p>

        <p>This alone can take them very far.</p>

        <p>
          I sometimes wish I had learned programming this way from the
          beginning. C is small, easy to understand, and it forces a beginner to
          learn the absolute fundamentals, like pointers.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I really don't see how this is significantly harder than web. The
          difference, I think, is that with binary exploitation you start with
          the knowledge and apply it to create an exploit, whereas with web you
          often start with an exploit and work backward to understand the
          underlying concepts.
