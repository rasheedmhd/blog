        <h1>
          What it means when a CPU resets itself during a fatal exception.
        </h1>

        <h3>What is a Fatal Exception</h3>

        <p>
          A fatal exception is an exception that the CPU canâ€™t handle which
          causes the CPU to reset. I have also written about exceptions
          <a target="_blank" href="interrupts.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>A Double Fault Exception</h3>
        <p>
          When an exception happens the processor is signaled to handle it.
          Within the time that the processor tries to handle the exception, If
          another exception happens, it is called a double fault exception. And
          a double fault exception is raised by the processor.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you read the link above you will realize that the way the processor
          handles exceptions is to call the function that is mapped to the
          exception raised in the IDT.
        </p>

        <p>
          What happens if there is no handler? A Triple Fault exception occurs.
          At this point the processor has had enough. It has no way of handling
          a Triple Fault so it resets itself. Now that is what we term a fatal
          exception. An exception that kills. Ha!
        </p>

        <h3>How the processor does a reset</h3>
        <p>
          When a reset happens the processor reads and executes instructions
          from memory. That is it. You want more? Okay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memory here refers to both RAM and ROM. RAM is the processors
          workplace. It loads instructions from disk into the RAM and executes
          them sequentially providing the user with desired outcome of the
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          ROM is the non-volatile part of the memory that the processor reads
          from first when the computer starts. It is hard coded with
          instructions for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test"
            >Power-On Self-Test(POST)</a
          >. It contains firmware,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">BIOS</a> which usually
          tells the processor where to load the operating system from.
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <h3>Reset Circuitry</h3>

        <p>
          The board has a reset circuitry that is used for resetting the
          Computer. When a Triple Fault occurs the reset circuitry causes high
          voltage to pass through the reset pin which is usually set at low
          voltage. Maintaining the high voltage to the reset pin for some clock
          cycles causes the processor to reset some major registers.
        </p>

        ></image>

        <p>
          After resetting the registers, the processor uses the CS and IP
          register to identify the memory address to load and execute. This
          address usually points to the BIOS.
        </p>

        <h3>Reset Vector.</h3>
        <p>
          Aside from using the CS and IP like we saw above some computers hard
          code the location of the BIOS into an address in the ROM called the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reset_vector">Reset Vector</a>.
          On reset, the processor therefore knows exactly where to load the
          first instruction to execute.
