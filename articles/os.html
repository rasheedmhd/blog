            <h1> This is a Public Commitment: I am writing a Computer Operating System from Scratch! </h1>

            <p>
                Wait! What? Yes, I am for real. I am writing a Computer Operating System from Scratch. Who hasn’t heard
                of what operating systems are? If you are here, you definitely have. What are they? How do they work?
                Why are they so important? Where do they come from? Can one, through pure grit and determination with a
                little smartness, build their own toy OS?
            </p>

            <p>
                I don’t have answers to above questions yet, but it is my goal to get all the answers of the above
                questions and even more and I intent to share the answers with anyone interested.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am starting from scratch trying to understand what operating systems are and how to build one. For the
                next weeks, months or years, I will be learning the Rust programming language and learning about
                operating systems, when it is all said and done, I will have a brand new operating system written in
                Rust that I would love to share with the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting from this post, I commit myself to hours of learning and sharing what I learn publicly. If you
                want to go on this journey with me, I will be posting updates on my <a
                    href="https://www.twitter.com/RasheedStarlet" target="_blank"> Twitter </a> and I will share full
                blog posts on this site. If all goes well, I will be making YouTube videos on how I learn and build
                stuff.
            </p>

            <p>
                A little about me, I wrote my first codes in 2016 batch file viruses, I will write a blog post in detail
                later.
