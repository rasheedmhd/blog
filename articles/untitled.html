    <h1>Building an Operating System Journey</h1>

    <p>At the time I met yaw, I had stopped programming actively, and when I wanted to come back, I wanted to get a job rather than trying to build startups. Amin suggested that I do Udacity Nanodegree for the certification since I didn't have any qualifications. I bought the course - got into heart-breaking personal issues - and never finished it. I was charged $100 monthly till I could no longer pay.</p>

    <p>I reached the APIs module, learned it and was tasked to build an API project to complete the 2nd project of the course. It had 3 parts/projects.</p>

    <p>I built parts of the API, but the catch was that the front end of the project was written with React, and I didn't know React.</p>

    <p>I think it is unfair that the course didn't mention React as a prerequisite and didn't offer React for free but expected me to know it before continuing with the project.</p>

    <p>I set out to use a full month to do React and come back to continue the project, so I wrote to them asking them to allow me to continue the course without the fee or at least with a $25/month fee, and they said they could only reduce it to $75, but that was still high for me, so I decided to stop. A course that was originally $2,100. I ended up paying over $10,000, and they still refused to reduce it to $25/month for me.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Hmmm. Totally insane. I reached out to Amin saying it had been long since I did development and since I was coming back to take it again, I needed somewhere to begin and he recommended that course, basically for the certificate.

        <div class="chat">

        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> I went through this long write-up, and it has really opened my eye on where to focus.

        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">yaw:</span> And you need to change projects. I‚Äôll prepare a plan and share with you before the end of the week. The target isn‚Äôt any specific language, but becoming a better programmer overall. I replied - Alright. Thank you so much. I will patiently be waiting.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">yaw:</span> So you‚Äôd have to change languages often. Sounds good to you? I replied - Sounds perfect. I am in.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Great. I think I‚Äôve almost completed the curriculum. I need to firm up the resources and material. So give me until the end of this week to do that. I‚Äôll share the curriculum with you in the meantime when I‚Äôm on my laptop.

        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Alright. Thanks for your effort. I am patiently waiting ‚ù§Ô∏è

        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">yaw:</span> Oh man, that's a lot of books. Let‚Äôs see if you‚Äôre going to need them. I think you might. I‚Äôve formulated the nature of the program, and my estimate is that it can run start to finish in about 3 months. No less, but probably exceeding by a couple of weeks or even a month. I‚Äôve planned an 8-hour workday schedule. All of that isn‚Äôt spent on coding by the way. There‚Äôs a lot of reading, lots of research, and lots of writing.

        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">yaw:</span> I also figured it‚Äôs important to have another person in the group. Do you know anyone who‚Äôd like to grow as a programmer? We can get them involved.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> I have a friend who would like but I am not sure he will dedicate the time. I don't think he is that serious at the moment.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">yaw:</span> That said, there are 5 projects to choose 2 from:

            - The Money Game ‚Äî Adam Smith

The system I‚Äôm developing here targets exciting various parts of your brain to improve alertness. It also greatly enhances your ability to make connections between apparently unrelated domains. Soft copies are okay, I think.

        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Just like the yaw promised, the breaking ice part of toprank was to get us to set up our blogs under our domain names and blogging our progress. The first blog of what was supposed to be a public commitment. I set up my website. And on 20th November made my public commitment post found here. I took a screenshot of it and posted it on my WhatsApp status and a friend ridiculed me, asking what drugs I was on, saying that I was going to build an Operating System. Right there I knew I had to hold myself accountable to the commitment and prove people wrong as well.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> A few weeks in, my friends dropped out of the project, and it was left with me alone. And reality dawned on me that, If I didn‚Äôt go out all on this, I was going to eventually give up. One thing that kept me going was that I viewed this as the biggest chance I have ever had in becoming the sort of programmer that I always aspired to become. And I have been searching for such an opportunity and never got so I wasn‚Äôt going to f*ck up.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> It was a do or die for me. It was hard, I was scared, I was intimidated. I dreamt several times of being haunted by the codes that I was trying to understand. But this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and I wasn‚Äôt willing to let it slide away ever.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> After toiling day and night, reading thousands of pages and lines of codes and writing thousands of lines of code I finally reached the end of the curriculum.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Plot twist. A few days ago I was bathing and was reminiscing on the UI that I drew for the operating system that I wanted to create growing up and it hit me that it wasn‚Äôt an operating system that I wanted to build. It was a windowing system. Remember I didn‚Äôt know anything about Operating Systems. I thought the OS was the UI but now the OS I wrote doesn‚Äôt even have a windowing system. It simply displays to a VGA Text Buffer. That was a settling feeling and realization for me.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> <strong>Oubre OS has a Godfather</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> If Oubre OS is my child, yaw is Oubre‚Äôs Godfather. Without yaw, there is no Oubre. Starting the story in the early days lets you understand that building an OS was just a trivial dream like everyone has. But I met yaw, He had intentions for TopRank before he ever met anyone called Rasheed. I just happened to be blessed with good luck to have met yaw. I got an opportunity and took it. The opportunity only came because of my love for connecting and learning from people smarter than me. When he posted on DevCongress, I could have decided not to go and stay home and watch YouTube all day. But I didn‚Äôt.
        </div>
        <div class="chat">
            <span class="chat-author">me:</span> Till today, I ask myself why yaw decided to mentor me. Why me? But following the story, you realized he was pained by my encounter with Udacity. How did I start Udacity in the first place? Through Amin‚Äôs recommendation. At the time I wasn‚Äôt friends with yaw, if I knew yaw and went to him saying, hey sir, I want to pay GHS 13,000 to mentor me, he would never do it. I probably didn‚Äôt also have that money lying around to pay him, even if I had, I would be too dumb to pay him. I would have used it to buy Bitcoin. This is a story of how we plan and life plans as well. I usually quote myself saying ‚ÄúEveryone has plans and life has plans as well. And life doesn‚Äôt give a f*ck about our plans‚Äù. There is a quote that says ‚ÄúLuck is when preparation meets opportunity‚Äù. All I did was prepare and yaw presented the opportunity. Without the opportunity there would be no Oubre OS. If yaw didn‚Äôt add the OS project in TopRank there would be no Oubre. I say this because the OS story has brought me so far - becoming an all-rounded programmer - but the lesson isn‚Äôt that I built an OS. It is all the lessons I learned doing TopRank and oh! Boy! Oh boy! I learned a lot.
