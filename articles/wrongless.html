				<h1>Superthinking: Chapter 1 - Being Wrong Less</h1>

				<p>You make decisions everyday. In every day decision making,
				ideally you want to be right more often than you are wrong</p>
				
				<p>Be like Charles Jacobi: Invert, always invert. Thinking about
				problems from inverse perspectives can give you totally new
				insights on how to solve it, We talked about this in the
				previous write up. Eg: Let's say in a football game - FIFA -
				playing with friends the thinking would be to score goals and
				inverse of that would be to concede less goals. When investing
				in money instead of thinking of making more money, an inverse
				would be to loss less money.</p>
				
				<p>As stated above about been right
				more often than being wrong, In a dynamic world I cannot
				overstate how hard that can be to achieve. With most things we
				can only connect the dots looking backwards as Steve Jobs said.
				With the help of inverse thinking we can focus on not being
				right all times but been less wrong.</p> 
				<p>Take unforced error for
				example. Caused by our own bad judgement. Taking it back to FIFA
				unforced errors happen all the time. Especially when your
				opponent's focus is to score and score as much as they can, they
				usually make mistakes in defense, passes, dribbles, take baits
				before all they care is to score. With An inverse thinking of
				let's say not conceding less goals, my approach has always been
				to concede less goals, and that means holding the ball more,
				making less bad passes, keep a tight defense and this always
				wins. The best scenarios where I have found this really useful
				in FIFA is during last minutes when I need a winning goal or
				need to draw the game. This when my opponents wants to play
				their best, and they become nervous, they start to overwork,
				they probably over fit. Meanwhile on my side I am calm as ever
				and I still play as if I am focused on conceding less but make
				no mistake I am in for a kill. And I tell them, I am a better
				player at last minute and that I will score and mostly they end
				up making mistakes and end up getting my goal. To be wrong less,
				you need to minimize making unforced errors.</p>
				
				<p>Now that you know
				about unforced errors, check everywhere you find yourself, you
				will see unforced errors. That's why it is a super model. I used
				the FIFA example because it is a game I have been learning and
				playing with friends of late, but I could have just used several
				places where you can apply unforced errors but I will leave that
				to you to find out.</p>
				
				<p>Anti-fragile - get better, like they say
				what doesn't kill you makes you stronger - If your thinking is
				anti-fragile, then it gets better over time as you learn from
				your mistakes and interact with your surroundings</p>
