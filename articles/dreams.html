        <h1>I am not a terrible friend, I just chose my dreams.</h1>

        <p>
          If there is any thing that I have watched spoil, it would be my
          relationship with people. I am notoriously known for been the guy who
          doesn't go out. Who is stuck indoors forever, and in fact I usually
          joke that if they ever put me in prison and gave me a books and the
          internet they would be doing me a great favour not a punishment.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most important thing to me Right now is to make the best of my
          20s. I am in my mid 20s and I view this to be the best time to make
          all the mistakes that I can ever make. To get beautiful things and
          takes risky decisions that can potentially mess them up. But if not
          now when? I am never afraid to try new things, I am never afraid to
          take risks, I am all in for the lessons.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to retire early - so I can build businesses - I have dreams
          that I want to pursue and to me it requires a lot of sacrifice. A lot
          of me time just learning and honing my skills. So I spend all my time
          just learning and becoming a better individual. I study a lot, read a
          lot. Study technical materials and self development materials. Whiles
          I am chasing virtuosity in the skill sets that I have decided to
          build, their is not much time spending it with people. There is not
          much time keeping up with the jones, texting people, calling people.
          Going out for parties, outings, dates etc. My focus is spending an
          incredible amount of time learning and honing my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          To all the people that I created something with, maybe I gave you the
          false impression that the relationship was going to last be it quickly
          withered away when there was more time committed needed from my end, I
          am sorry. And to all who have tried to have something going on with me
          but feel snubbed or rejected, I am sorry. It is not you that is at
          fault. It is me. And I sincerely apologize. For now I am all about my
          dreams.
