          "The second major development on the software scene that I would like
          to mention is the birth of FORTRAN. At that time this was a project of
          great temerity and the people responsible for it deserve our great
          admiration. It would be absolutely unfair to blame them for
          shortcomings that only became apparent after a decade or so of
          extensive usage: groups with a successful look-ahead of ten years are
          quite rare! In retrospect we must rate FORTRAN as a successful coding
          technique, but with very few effective aids to conception, aids which
          are now so urgently needed that time has come to consider it out of
          date. The sooner we can forget that FORTRAN has ever existed, the
          better, for as a vehicle of thought it is no longer adequate: it
          wastes our brainpower, is too risky and therefore too expensive to
          use. FORTRAN's tragic fate has been its wide acceptance, mentally
          chaining thousands and thousands of programmers to our past mistakes.
          I pray daily that more of my fellow-programmers may find the means of
          freeing themselves from the curse of compatibility.""

          "LISP, a fascinating enterprise of a completely different nature. With
          a few very basic principles at its foundation, it has shown a
          remarkable stability. Besides that, LISP has been the carrier for a
          considerable number of in a sense our most sophisticated computer
          applications. LISP has jokingly been described as ‚Äúthe most
          intelligent way to misuse a computer‚Äù. I think that description a
          great compliment because it transmits the full flavour of liberation:
          it has assisted a number of our most gifted fellow humans in thinking
          previously impossible thoughts. "
        </p>

        <p>
          "The famous Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 is the fruit
          of a genuine effort to carry abstraction a vital step further and to
          define a programming language in an implementation-independent way.
          One could argue that in this respect its authors have been so
          successful that they have created serious doubts as to whether it
          could be implemented at all! The report gloriously demonstrated the
          power of the formal method BNF, now fairly known as Backus-Naur-Form,
          and the power of carefully phrased English, at least when used by
          someone as brilliant as Peter Naur. I think that it is fair to say
          that only very few documents as short as this have had an equally
          profound influence on the computing community. The ease with which in
          later years the names ALGOL and ALGOL-like have been used, as an
          unprotected trade mark, to lend some of its glory to a number of
          sometimes hardly related younger projects, is a somewhat shocking
          compliment to its standing. The strength of BNF as a defining device
          is responsible for what I regard as one of the weaknesses of the
          language: an over-elaborate and not too systematic syntax could now be
          crammed into the confines of very few pages. With a device as powerful
          as BNF, the Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 should have
          been much shorter. Besides that I am getting very doubtful about ALGOL
          60‚Äôs parameter mechanism: it allows the programmer so much
          combinatorial freedom, that its confident use requires a strong
          discipline from the programmer. Besides expensive to implement it
          seems dangerous to use. "
        </p>
        <p>
          "Finally, although the subject is not a pleasant one, I must mention
          PL/1, a programming language for which the defining documentation is
          of a frightening size and complexity. Using PL/1 must be like flying a
          plane with 7000 buttons, switches and handles to manipulate in the
          cockpit. I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs
          firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the
          programming language ‚Äîour basic tool, mind you!‚Äî already escapes our
          intellectual control. And if I have to describe the influence PL/1 can
          have on its users, the closest metaphor that comes to my mind is that
          of a drug. I remember from a symposium on higher level programming
          language a lecture given in defense of PL/1 by a man who described
          himself as one of its devoted users. But within a one-hour lecture in
          praise of PL/1. he managed to ask for the addition of about fifty new
          ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù, little supposing that the main source of his problems
          could very well be that it contained already far too many ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù.
          The speaker displayed all the depressing symptoms of addiction,
          reduced as he was to the state of mental stagnation in which he could
          only ask for more, more, more... When FORTRAN has been called an
          infantile disorder, full PL/1, with its growth characteristics of a
          dangerous tumor, could turn out to be a fatal disease."
