        <h1>Exceptions and Interrupts</h1>

        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>
          Exceptions occur when the processor encounters an error while
          processing an instruction. For example, if the processor encounters a
          divide by zero operation. They occur within the currently executing
          task. When exceptions occur they signal the processor to call a
          function predefined in a memory structure called the Interrupt
          Descriptor Table. This is called exception handling.
        </p>

        <h3>Interrupt</h3>
        <p>
          An Interrupt is a method that a peripheral device uses to communicate
          with the processor. Interrupts are signals to the processor telling it
          that there is an event coming from the peripheral device that it needs
          to handle.
        </p>

        <h3>Memory-mapped I/O(MMIO)</h3>
        <p>
          MMIO is another mechanism that peripheral devices use to communicate
          to the processor. MMIO uses the same address space for I/O devices and
          main memory. The memory and registers are mapped to the address space.
          Since one address space is used for main memory and I/O devices, an
          address might be mapped to main memory or an I/O device. MMIO has a
          complementary method called <b>Port-Mapped I/O.</b>
        </p>

        <h3>Polling</h3>
        <p>
          Polling is another method that the processor uses to communicate with
          I/O devices. In polling the processor has to constantly ping the I/O
          device to see if it is ready for access, if it is not, the processor
          returns to a different task and comes back later to check again,
          repeatedly. This is wasteful of the processor resources. An
          interrupt-driven I/O method as mentioned above is usually better.
        </p>
        <p>
          In I/O device to processor communication, the processor can always
          choose to handle the Interrupt Request immediately or schedule it for
          later.
        </p>

        <h3>Exceptions v Interrupts</h3>

        <p>
          Exceptions and Interrupts are basically the same at their core. They
          only differ in the contexts in which they occur. Interrupts occur
          asynchronously while exceptions occur synchronously.
        </p>
        <p>
          When exceptions and interrupts occur, the processor is forced to pause
          the executing task to handle them. The current task is paused, its
          state parked, the exception or interrupt is handled, and then the task
          is resumed. The question, are all tasks pause-able and how the
          processor determines exactly when to pause them is not discussed here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exceptions occur synchronously within the context of the running
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interrupts occur out of the executing task. They are used by
          peripheral devices to signal the processor instead.
        </p>

        <h3>Interrupt Descriptor Table</h3>

        <p>
          The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a mapping of interrupts and
          exceptions to their handlers. Each interrupt or exception is assigned
          a fixed vector (number) in the IDT which maps to its handle. So when
          an interrupt or exception occurs the processor uses its vector number
          to retrieve and call its handler. This is called interrupt or
          exception handling.
        </p>

        <p>
          The IDT is a table of 255 mappings. The first 32 are reserved and
          mapped to well known interrupts by the hardware. The first 32 entries
          of the table have mappings of interrupts/exceptions to functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining are available for the programmer to setup the interrupt
          system. With interrupts, there is the Programmable Interrupt Chips
          that helps the processor handle interrupt requests from multiple
          sources (e.g. external I/O devices).
        </p>

        <h3>Applying the idea of the IDT to a user-space program</h3>
        <p>
          A web server could be configured with a table of error codes mapped to
          web pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          The web server could be asked to query a particular database across
          the world for user profiles. Depending on the response the web server
          gets from the database it displays a particular web page to the user.
          The response could be HTTP error codes. Based on the error code
          received, the web server displays the page that was mapped to it in
          its internal table.
        </p>

        <p>
          A good API design would require the developer to map error codes to
          specific error handlers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This design would require that when a particular kind of error code is
          encountered, a handler function that corresponds to the error code
          mapping is called.
        </p>
