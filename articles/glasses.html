            <h1> What my glasses taught me about life. </h1>

            <p>
                For my whole life I never wore glasses.
                It was clear I wasnâ€™t seeing from afar though.
                We tried a lot of local medicines but none ultimately worked.
                I was told I had to wear glasses. I dreaded the idea. I even lost my first glasses in SHS because I
                wasnâ€™t wearing them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I donâ€™t have answers to above questions yet, but it is my goal to get all the answers of the above
                questions and even more and I intent to share the answers with anyone interested.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally I succumbed to the idea. Got myself glasses a second time, April of last year when I was in
                Accra.
                At first it was weird wearing them. It was terrible. It was uncomfortable. But I tried and kept wearing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Months later, I am now used to the glasses. Without wearing them I lose focus of the world. I lose part
                vision of the world. Now wearing them is comfortable and not wearing them is uncomfortable. Thatâ€™s
                interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
                What this experience has taught me is that, in life some experiences can be terribly uncomfortable but
                if we accept them, and live with them, over time, they become comfortable and they change our life in
                several magnitudes that we could have never imagined.
            </p>

            <p>
                In life accept the uncomfortable, learn to live with them everyday, they will be the first nuisance when
                you wake up in the morning but one day you will wake up and they will be the second nuisance and one day
                you wonâ€™t remember that they used to hurt you. And just like that live gets better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Stay safe, love you: ðŸ˜˜
