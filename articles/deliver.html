        <h1>Reflections on Execution and Delivery</h1>

        <p>
          I sent a message to my friend on WhatsApp. In it I mentioned that I am
          getting to understand a friend and mentor better, Let's call this
          friend Jim. I say that in relation to moments he gets angry and blasts
          you. One thing that at least I thought was that he would act different
          based on who was part of the receiving end, let's say a friend, an age
          mate. But with a recent experience I was convinced that he can't help
          himself with that. To be fair to him, he tries, because at moments
          when someone he respects - a friend/age mate is at the receiving end,
          he would say something like, "I am not in a good mood right now, let's
          talk about this - what is causing the bad mood - later"
        </p>

        <p>My friend replied:</p>
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>".. Africa here we're not used to unnecessary blasting.."</p>
        </div>
        <p>And I sent a qouted reply:</p>
        <p>
          Well, I intended to send a short reply but I kept on writing and
          writing and thought, oh, this is a nice idea. Let me put it in a blog
          post and here we are.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            ".. Africa here we're not used to unnecessary blasting.." - that's
            why we don't have nice things.
          </p>
        </div>

          He gets pissed when you don't deliver. When you deliver, he praises
          you and awards you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I doubt you can build any good company with people who don't deliver,
          are not accountable for anything. See our government institutions, see
          the negligence from our health professionals and institutions, and
          several other professionals and institutions, heck even artisans,
          maybe Ghanaians? I am not sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me it is an easy choice to make, if you can't deliver, quit and
          enjoy life in your mediocrity but if you say you want to do this and
          sign up, you might naturally not be someone who delivers, so you take
          up the challenge and deliver. You Do, Fail - get blasted - and Learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I think if you are somebody hungry for growth, not delivering
          should pain you enough so blasting isn't necessary, your superior
          might lose it or not realise yet and blast you anyway but if they are
          good in leading/mentoring, I would expect them to realise your past
          performance and take this as a one time thing and encourage you to
          perform not blast you. Worse case scenario you get blasted, take it
          any way. I would expect them to not lean into their availability bias
          so thay can make an objective decision and how to deal with the
          issues. They might be an asshole and Tony Fadell in

          Chapter 2.3 tells us to determine what kind of assholes they are - by
          asking why -, and take it from their frame of reference and learn how
          to deal with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nothing great comes from cozying and and doing the bare minimum. I
          don't know, but I believe to build a significant company that is worth
          its weight, you need people pushing above their weight or at least, at
          the bare minimum delivering on the tasks assigned to them and a bonus,
          helping their team members, again if they can't they should quit the
          job there is no shame in that. In fact it is honourable to accept
          defeat early and not waste everyone's time and the company's
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work can always be too much and too less time to execute - there
          are so many variables here that I won't dive into that now - remember
          when you drew my attention to hybeecodes? (a question to my friend)
          <a href="https://youtu.be/_Tvw1L3ugXw?si=ub1Jt9WarawXyVFu&t=232"
            >video on why he left Paystack?</a
          >
          Because he was doing two jobs and didn't want his delivery and
          executiom to suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's the kind of people you need. Execute and Deliver, if they sense
          they are failing, they should be able to take an unsupervised
          initiative to improve he situation and themselves or quit if they
          think it is too much, and I mentioned why I didn't get too much
          disturbed with my termination with Stac.ai because deep down I knew I
          could do better. And for the people quitting, Tony Fadell talks about
          that in Build Chapter 2.4 (I Quit).

        <p>
          When he(Jim) lost it and was angry I came out with a mental model to
          deal with people like that, and I thought if you are working with Jim,
          there are only 4 things that matters
        </p>

        <p>
          1.‚Å† ‚Å†Make a commitment to yourself to never get blasted in standup and
          let that be important to you as oxygen or water.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.‚Å† ‚Å†Identify your wildly important goals (See
          <a
            href="http://wesleyboardresources.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Four-Disciplines-of-Execution-Book-Overview.pdf"
          >
            The 4 Disciplines of Execution [pdf p.28 ‚Üó] </a
          >)
        </p>
        <p>3.‚Å† ‚Å†Execute on time, deliver on time. Job Done. Repeat.</p>

        <p>
          4.‚Å† ‚Å†This is more like a slogan and should help with you with sticking
          to the 3 points earlier. You see how when a baby wants something and
          you don't give them and they start crying and throwing tantrums? Good,
          So you frame the situation as,
        </p>
        <div class="highlight">
          <p>
            "Jim is a baby üçº, if I don't execute and deliver, he is going to
            lose it and throw tantrums, and I want to be a good lad so please
            Execute and Deliver".
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I am just realising that with this framing in puts you top of your
          issues rather that Jim been on top dictating on what you should do /
          micromanaging you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rise up to the task, improve to execute, execute and deliver, Jim
          doesn't blast you. The company progresses. Everybody wins.
