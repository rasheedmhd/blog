				"Africa here we're not used to unnecessary blasting" - that's
				why we don't have nice things. He gets pissed when you don't
				deliver. When you deliver, he praises you and awards you. I
				doubt you can built any good company with people who don't
				deliver, are not accountable for anything. See our government
				institutions, see the negligence from our health professionals
				and institutions. For me it is an easy choice to make, if you
				can't deliver, quit and enjoy life in your mediocrity but if you
				say you want to do this and sign up, you might naturally not be
				someone who delivers, so you take up the challenge and deliver.
				You Do, Fail - get blasted - Learn. And I think if you are
				somebody hungry for growth, not delivering should pain you
				enough so blasting isn't necessary, your superior might lose it
				or not realise yet and blast you anyway but if they are good in
				leading/mentoring I would expect them to realise your past
				performance and take this as a one time thing and encourage you
				to perform not blast you. Worse case scenario you get blasted,
				take it any way. They might be an asshole and Tony Fadell tells
				us to determine what kind of asshole they are, and take it from
				their frame or reference and get better. Nothing good comes from
				cozying and and doing the bare minimum..I don't know but I
				believe to build a significant company that is worth its weight,
				you need people pushing above their weight or at least, at the
				bare minimum delivering on the tasks assigned to them and a
				bonus helping their team members, again if they can't they
				should quit, the job there is no shame in that. In fact it is
				honourable to accept defeat early and not waste everyones time
				and the company's resources. The work can always be too much and
				too less time to execute - their are so many variables here that
				I won't dive into that - remember when you drew my attention to
				hybeecodes video on why he left Paystack ? Because he was doing
				two jobs and didn't want his delivery and executing to suffer?
				That's the kind of people you need. Execute and Deliver, if they
				sense they are failing, they should quit, and I mentioned why I
				get too much disturbed with my termination with Stac.ai because
				deep down I knew I could do better. And for the people quitting,
				Tony Fadell talks about that in Build Chapter 2.4 (I Quit) When
				he lost it and was angry I came out with a mental model to deal
				with people like that, and I thought if you are working with
				this guy, there are only 4 things that matters 1.‚Å† ‚Å†Make a
				commitment to yourself to never get blasted in standup and let
				that be important to you as oxygen or water. 2.‚Å† ‚Å†Identify you
				wildly important goals (See The 4 Disciplines or Execution) 3.‚Å†
				‚Å†Execute on time, deliver on time. Job Done. Repeat. 4.‚Å† ‚Å†This
				is more like a slogan and should help with your sticking to
				these more points. You see how when a baby wants something and
				you don't give them and they start crying and throwing and
				tantrums? Good, So you frame the situation as "Yaw is a baby üçº,
				if you don't execute and deliver, he is going to lose it and
				throw tantrums, You want to be a good lad so please Execute and
				Deliver". I am just realising that with this framing in puts
				your top of your issues rather that your boss been on top
				dictating on what you should do.
