				<h1>2022 and beyond - Dreams and Aspirations</h1>

				<p>
					It is a brand new day. A brand new opportunity to make
					something great
				</p>

				<p>
					Every single day I wake up with the intentions of
					contemplating and making the best long term strategic
					decisions that I can make.
				</p>

				<p>
					I like to admire the present but I hardly expect anything to
					happen quickly. Those expectations will quickly drain your
					motivation. I have studied a lot of history about the most
					relevant companies of today and one thing that always cut
					across is that the founders usually work on the ideas for at
					least a decade and acquired skills within the past decade
					that lead to their current successes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Thatâ€™s why it is important for me at this age to make very
					clear, consistent and strategic decisions of my life since I
					am very young and trying to achieve the best I can in my
					short life on this planet.
				</p>

				<p>
					I started my entrepreneurial journey by learning how to code
					and building startups to ran them myself because I never
					wanted to work for anyone. None of them really worked
					though. I tried building, Trendz - social media platform
					that had dislike button. Vlick a virtual reality oriented
					social media platform. Yapaala.com an all-in-one room
					renting platform. Hammerfy.com A kind of wayfair.com for
					Ghanaians.
				</p>

				<p>
					I teamed up with a dear friend and a brother to build a
					crypto company(www.instagram.com/bitperse) to serve the
					African market but I quickly realised that Ghana was no
					Silicon Valley. Within the first few months we grew very
					quickly and just as we Grew, we stumbled quickly and I was
					back to square zero.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the past decades technically inclined CEOs have been on
					the rise. Most of the best CEOs in the world are not from a
					business management background but from engineering. It
					doesnâ€™t surprise me because engineers do a lot of critical
					thinking and problem solving and in a world that is
					constantly changing one can only argue that those are the
					skills required for outstanding success.
				</p>

				<p>
					What I am teaching myself now is problem solving and
					strategic decision making through software development. I
					made this decision not because I was taught in school or I
					was directed by a higher up. I dropped out of school so that
					I could focus on learning the things that mattered to me
					most and that goes to tell you that I am very opinionated
					about my decisions in life and yet very flexible to change
					when I learn new things. I am making this decision from what
					I have learnt in the past years on the internet about how
					the world we know today came to be and the direction in
					which it is going. I definitely want to be at the forefront
					of technological innovations that change life for the
					better.
				</p>

				<p>
					I might not have a huge impact on the world Right now like I
					want to, but every time that I write a line of code, I am
					imagining that, at this young age if I am able to write
					software that thousands of people use, what would I build in
					the next decade?
				</p>

				<p>As I end the year, this will be my focus henceforth.</p>
