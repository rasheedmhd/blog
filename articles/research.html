				<h1>You and Your Research (How about a 7/10?)</h1>

				<h3>What is in a Title?</h3>

				<p>
					I am participating in a Software Engineering mentorship
					program, and in it, my mentor gave us this video by Richard
					Hamming to watch and present our lessons learnt. Little did
					we know that marks were going to be awarded and we performed
					unacceptably woeful that he decided to go blunt on us,
					saying we did a bullshit job. We were 3 in number, First
					presenter got 1/10, I got 3/10 and the last guy got 0/10. He
					didn’t even watch the whole video, can you imagine?.
				</p>

				<p>
					Coincidentally when all hell broke lose and my mentor was
					giving marks I guessed I would get 3/10 and that is what he
					gave me. He asked us to rewatch the video and present our
					lessons the next day, This is my lesson preparation article
					and I hope to get at least get 7/10 hence the title. I am
					putting in my best and hoping, I get that, anything below
					that is unacceptable.
				</p>

				<p>
					You and Your Research is a speech given by Richard(Rich)
					Wesley Hamming in June 5, 1995. It is a culmination of his
					decades long direct observation of scientists at the Bell
					Labs where he worked. The talk is about how one can define
					their own success and research their way towards achieving
					it. One's own success(important work) is been likened to
					Nobel-Prize winning work to denote how important one's
					success should be viewed as.
				</p>

				<h3>Why is the talk important?</h3>

				<p>
					We have one finite life. If we only get one chance to do
					this life thing, why don’t we use it to do significant work?
				</p>

				<p>
					Work that would benefit us and benefit society? In the talk
					Richard Hamming tries to convince us on why it is important
					that we do important great work and also motivate us with
					his story aiming at making us ask if he could do it, why
					can’t we achieve significant work on our own? And he lays
					down important direct observatory guidelines on how to
					achieve significant work should we decide to pursue.
				</p>

				<p>
					Below are lessons that I learnt from watching the 44 minutes
					long video several times and How I plan to incorporate the
					lessons into my life to achieve success in the field of
					software engineering and several aspects of life that
					interest me.
				</p>

				<h3>1. The Mathew Effect</h3>

				<p>
					"Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an
					abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will
					be taken from them" - Mathew 13:12
				</p>

				<p>
					If you have talents, the world gives you more but if you
					lack any talents more is taken from you. And this is true in
					science. If you do significant work in science you are
					rewarded. You get to access to events/places that you
					wouldn’t have gotten access were it not for your work and
					this access opens up opportunities for you to learn and
					connect with more important people and this ultimately leads
					you to doing more important work.
				</p>

				<p>
					A way to use this Effect to your advantage is to identify
					skillsets that will improve your overall human capital
					resource. Skillsets that the world values, the skills will
					pave way for you in the sense that if you have skillsets
					that is valuable to the world, you can be rest assured that
					someone will need your service.
				</p>

				<h3>2. Fame is not Luck.</h3>

				<p>
					Luck favours the prepared mind. You have to prepare yourself
					before luck hits you. There are so many ways luck can hit
					you. You can look at Richard Feynman and Einstein they both
					did significant works before they won any Nobel-Prize. Doing
					great work is part Luck and Part preparation. And the way I
					understand it is you have to prepare yourself every single
					day, I say it as, I am going to wake up every single day and
					do the best work that I can do, and if I am able to do that,
					then I am done for the day, tomorrow I will wake up and
					continue, I might not get success today but months or years
					later I am going to wake up one day and realise that I did
					it. Luck alone won’t put you there, preparation alone will
					get you somewhere but not there, you need both luck and
					preparation (Consistent daily progress) to hit gold. If
					hardwork alone works General Magic should have made the
					iPhone not Apple. Luck + Preparedness = Great Success, or at
					least puts you on the right path to achieving it.
				</p>

				<h3>3. Hard work</h3>
				<p>
					Edison says, “Genius is 99% perspiration and 1%
					inspiration.” Hamming mentioned how he asked his boss about
					John Tukey, “How can anybody my age know as much as John
					Tukey does?” He leaned back in his chair, put his hands
					behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, “You would be
					surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as
					hard as he did that many years.” Newton said, “If others
					would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar
					results. Doing work is partly luck but luck alone doesn’t
					cut it. One must be prepared to handle such great work
					before luck hands in. The race is not for the swiftest The
					guy that works the hardest doesn’t win. It is the guy that
					works on the right problem, at the right time, the right way
					that wins.
				</p>

				<p>
					“Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.”
					Given two people of approximately the same ability and one
					person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter
					will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you
					know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you
					can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity – it
					is very much like compound interest. You have to neglect
					things if you intend to get what you want done. There's no
					question about this. The misapplication of effort is a very
					serious matter. Just hard work is not enough – it must be
					applied sensibly.
				</p>

				<h3>4. Harnessing the Power of Ambiguity</h3>

				<p>
					Ambiguity allows you to accept contractions to your
					believes. It allows you to doubt your believes. Great
					scientist believe their theory enough to get started doing
					work and they doubt it enough to notice errors in their
					believes. Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found
					it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which
					appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they
					would disappear from his mind. When you find apparent flaws
					you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things,
					and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the
					theory can be changed to fit them.
				</p>

				<h3>5. “Creativity comes out of your subconscious.”</h3>

				<p>
					So it Is important to constantly think about your problem
					and focus on it only so that you subconscious has no choice
					than to work on providing you with answers even when you are
					asleep.
				</p>

				<h3>
					6. Do only important work - If it is not important dump it
				</h3>

				<p>
					If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely
					you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Hamming
					talks about how he confronted a scientist working on
					chemistry research and how the only one that listened and
					made use of his questioning, became famous and important. He
					would go to the chemist table at lunch and ask them the
					following questions. “What are the important problems of
					your field?” And after a week or so, “What important
					problems are you working on?” And after some more time I
					came in one day and said, “If what you are doing is not
					important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to
					something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on
					it?”
				</p>

				<h3>7. Great thoughts time - Friday evenings</h3>

				<p>
					Find a regular time to Stop and think about the important
					things. Try to understand the fundamentals and try to
					predict the fundamentals of the future. New learn things.
					Understand the bigger picture.
				</p>

				<h3>8. Identify Great work and contribute.</h3>

				<p>
					In search of identifying great work, lean on your guts, most
					people can be wrong on judging great work but If your guts
					says it is Pursue it.
				</p>

				<h3>
					9. Believe you can do great work - And have the courage to
				</h3>

				<p>
					High IQ. High IQ certainly helps but it is not everything.
					Some people like Newton and Einstein didn’t necessarily have
					high IQ by standard methods but they achieved great success.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you don’t believe you can do great work, you can never do
					it. Believe let’s you approach the problem with a problem
					solvers mind. A problem solver's mind asks the question "How
					can I solve this" not "I can't solve this". When you ask can
					how can I solve this, your brain gets to work, formulating
					ideas on how to solve the problem.
				</p>

				<p></p>

				<h3>
					10. Working behind closed doors won't get you far in the
					right direction
				</h3>

				<p>
					While this gets you very far, the downside is that most
					people that work with their doors closed hardly interact
					with people and they don’t get to know where the world is
					going so a higher percentage ends up working on the
					unimportant stuff.
				</p>

				<p>
					You have to plant little acorns that grow to oak trees. It
					is important to work on important things but you can’t
					always work on important things, sometimes you need to work
					on the small things that will grow to become the important
					things. You have to not work on just anything but important
					little things.
				</p>

				<h3>11. Over confidence is disaster.</h3>

				<p>
					There Is a fine line between confidence and over confidence.
					If you don’t learn to understand and separate the difference
					you will end up clinging too long to a bad idea or dumping a
					good idea too soon.
				</p>

				<p>
					Have a strong desire to do excellent work Get a vision -
					Your Vision should be to do excellent work
				</p>

				<h3>12. Good work conditions aren’t really Good.</h3>

				<p>
					Bad work conditions forces you to redefine your problems and
					it often leads to great ideas on how to solve the problem at
					hand. That is how the hamming methods were invented. You can
					change the conditions that you have to make success either
					by inverting the problem or changing the nature of the
					problem to identify the underlying real problem.
				</p>

				<h3>
					13. You should study your successes not study your failures.
				</h3>

				<p>
					I have always enjoyed studying success and failure stories
					but I enjoyed failure stories more because I saw that as a
					way to make sure that I don’t make such mistakes. Hence I
					strive to learn from the mistakes of others rather than to
					learn from experience. Learning from experience is costly. I
					have decided to study success stories more, studying more
					success stories will put me on the right path to achieving
					success faster. When I reach there, then I can decide to
					study some failure stories as failure cautionary tales to
					avoid finding myself in such predicaments. Studying success
					is a very good method of formulating your own style of
					achieving success.
				</p>

				<p>
					Problems are not important if you don’t know how to attack
					them. You can hold a lot of problems in your head but only
					approach them If you find an attack. If you find an attack
					of a problem you discard the others and pursue the attack.
					Attack = how to go about solving a problem.
				</p>

				<h3>14. It ain’t what you do, it Is how you do it.</h3>

				<p>
					It is not your solution it is how you solve it. You have to
					find a way to explain your solution to others and that has
					to do with how to communicate.
				</p>

				<h3>15. Learn how to Communicate your ideas</h3>

				<p>
					First you solve the problem in a way that you can easily
					explain to people then you formulate how to explain your
					solution to others. The 3 forms of communication. Learning
					from a Speeches. 1. You don’t just listen to a talk, you
					listen to how it is delivered. 2. What talks are effective ?
					3. Why were they effective ? 4. What aspects of the speaker
					can you adopt ?
				</p>

				<h3>16. Progress is not Change.</h3>

				<p>
					Without change you will not have progress. Big companies
					don’t like change, you can push your company to adopt
					changes.
				</p>

				<h3>
					17. Demonstrate you can do great work then you get great job
				</h3>

				<p>
					When you hire a plumber, you expect him to fix your pipes.
					You don’t give someone the chance to do something great when
					he has not already shown greatness. A researcher asked for
					time to do research and he was told that if he does the
					research, he will be given the break. You have to
					demonstrate you ability first then you have the freedom to
					do it.
				</p>

				<h3>19. The effort to be a great person.</h3>

				<p>
					Whatever been a great person means to you. When you do great
					work it feels amazing. In pursuit of feeling amazing, it is
					worth it been a great person.
				</p>

				<h3>
					20. “The unexamined life, is not worth living” - Socrates
				</h3>

				<br />

						After the presentation I got 5/10. Next time I gotta go
						harder!
