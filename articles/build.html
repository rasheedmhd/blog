				<h1>
					Notes on: Build - An unorthodox Guide to Making things worth
					Making.
				</h1>

				<h2>What is this book?</h2>
				<p>
					I started reading this book on my way to the Zebo HQ at
					Adenta in trotro. Most people sitting in Trotro always try
					to kill time by browsing social media. When I try it bores
					me off quickly. I can't always help it knowing that I am
					wasting my precious time which actually gets converted to
					money into someone's account.
				</p>

				<p>
					So I try to do something more worthwhile mostly educative
					videos on youtube or read something.
				</p>

				<h2>Why did I pick this book?</h2>
				<p>
					Good question, As I type this, there are over 70 books in a
					folder on my computer called "Self Development" in contains
					all my non technicals books with lessons I wish to learn and
					improve myself. But one the way to the office, I didn't
					reach out to any of those books. I got onto the internet
					searched Tony Fadell - Build and got the book and started
					reading - Sorry Tony, too broke to buy your book now, I
					promise to buy a paperback version someday, I promise. I
					have known about the book for a while, now. I think I first
					saw it one Amazon when it lauched two years ago.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am in the cross roads of potentially joining Zebo, might
					happen, might never happen I don't know. So I thought
					joining a startup and being the 3rd* non-national-service
					employee, I need to know more about building. I need to read
					a thing or two on building and out of the whim, I thought
					why not Build? the book's title is literally build.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reaching out for books that I need to learn a thing or two
					from, has been my thing for a very long time, I don't know
					how but strangely at some points in time, I just reach out
					for the right book that ends up changing my life completely
					or I end up learning very profound lessons exactly when I
					need them.
				</p>
				<p>
					In JHS 2 when I was fed up with school and started thinking
					certainly there is a way to become successful in life,
					someone brought Rich dad, Poor dad into our class, I glanced
					on it, saw that title and went like this is the book I was
					looking for, it felt like how facebook creepily shows you
					ads based on your google searches except that this was a
					good ad that literally changed my life. If I never read Rich
					Poor, Poor Dad within that time of fraustration, I would
					have probably caved to my mum's pressure and gone to the
					University and can you imagine how crazily different a life
					can be in this situation?. I know not everyone agrees with
					this decision but hey! this is my life, I pull the shorts
					here. Shafiu is still on my neck to come join him at KNUST.
				</p>

				<p>
					Aww, snap! Let's go back to Build. So yeah, finding myself
					closer and closer to joining a startup - not mine this time
					- a startup founded my people I respect and want to learn
					from - we will come back to this - I needed to read
					something little on Building. But when I picked up Build it
					was more like just read a few pages and see what I can learn
					from it and before I realized I was in Part IV as I type
					this. Some books are just that good, you say oh, lemme see
					what is inside and you lose track of time. That was how I
					read all of "The Psychology of Money" in a weekend.
				</p>

				<h2>Who is Tony Fadell?</h2>
				<p>
					So at the Zebo HQ, while I was reading this, an intern asked
					me what the book was about and I said "It is about building
					things, it is written by a guy called Tony Fadell. Do you
					know Thim?" He said No! and I said "He helped build the
					first iPod and also the iPhone". If that makes you want to
					read this book then you are at the right place if you feel
					indifferent then you probably shouldn't continue reading
					this. But Tony Fadell is much much more that than just that
					guy, He was at General Magic - They failed building the
					"iPhone" 15 years earlier before the world would grasped the
					concept of the iPhone, he built Nest which was later bought
					by Google. You see, I knew all these before I picked up the
					book, these helped in my decision to pick the book up when I
					had the thought. And also, I love hardware, got plans of
					building hardware startups when I secure some bag! Oh you
					don't know General Magic? There is a beautiful movie about
					them see
					<a href="https://youtu.be/uTdyb-RWNKo?si=SudDvWsng1k942dy"
						>General Magic: The Movie</a
					>
					and also this Slidebean
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGCLj4oVB0">
						video
					</a>
					- I think that is where I first learnt of General Magic -
					and this wikipedia page
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic"
						>General Magic</a
					>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Assume you are young, ambitious and eager to make a dent in
					the world. You build and put youreself on the path of
					greatness and soon you find yourself working with people
					that you would regard as your heroes because they have done
					amazing things, achieved so much and you wish to learn from
					them. But you didn't get there all alone, so many people
					helped you with lessons and as they say time and tide waits
					for no man, one day you realize they are no more. You
					realize you are now the one others come asking for advice
					and you want to put that advice in a box for everyone. That
					is what this book is. A book of advice. Advice Tony learnt
					from others and advice he learnt from mistakes, successes
					and the relentless ambition to build great products. He
					offers enough advice so you too can build great products,
					great not mediocre products. Tony believes that any one
					trying to build great products deserves a mentor so he put
					one in a book hoping that it might help you. of course this
					is not the only way, but one that worked for Tony, Steve
					Jobs and many other great builders.
				</p>

				<h2>Build Yourself: Failure is part of the Process.</h2>
				<p>
					Part one starts with this electrifying quote "I tried to
					build the iPhone twice. Everybody knows about the second
					time. The time we succeeded. Few people know about the
					first." You see what he did there? Do. Fail. Learn. Repeat
				</p>

				<p>
					Tony talks about his startup, he built a business that had
					employees and even an office but there was that realizationn
					that to go forth and build great products he still needed an
					apprenticeship and he found that in General Magic so he put
					himself in the path to getting that apprenticeship. Lesson
					is assessing the future of career and building the skills
					for the future.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whatever you learn in school is not enough, you need a PhD
					in the real world too. Hence you get a job. A job where
					there is a great opportunity to nead from the best.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your first job doesn't necessarily connect you to your
					future success. It is more of a back and forth journey.
					Every job is going to be a learning experience for you.
				</p>

				<h2>Chapter 1.1 Adulthood</h2>

				<p>
					Simple: Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up
					continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit
					less. Failure is important because sometimes that is the
					only way you can learn. Fuck around and found out, erh?
				</p>
				<p>
					This is so perfect that if I were to summarise, I would be
					doing you injustice. So when you ’re looking at the array of
					potential careers before you, the correct place to start is
					this: “What do I want to learn?” Not “How much money do I
					want to make?” Not “What title do I want to have?” Not “What
					company has enough name recognition that my mom can brutally
					crush the other moms when they boast about their kids?” The
					best way to find a job you ’ll love and a career that will
					eventually make you successful is to follow what you ’re
					naturally interested in, then take risks when choosing where
					to work. Follow your curiosity rather than a business school
					playbook about how to make money . Assume that for much of
					your twenties your choices will not work out and the
					companies you join or start will likely fail. Early
					adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and
					learning as much as you can from the ashes. Do, fail, learn.
					The rest will follow.
				</p>
				<p>
					The central theme of this chapter is choosing above
					everything else, trying and failing, learning from the
					experience and retrying again.
				</p>

				<p>
					Which soap do you currently use? I use Santex. Why because
					it was my mum's favourite and used it growing up, why
					change. Which do you use and why? Tony talks about how
					growing up most decisions are made for us by our parents and
					now we have this slight window to make decisions for
					ourselves. Decisions where our lives is at stake and it is a
					small fast moving window in which we must take control and
					make decisions and in this situation we should take risk. If
					they don't pan out good, we can learn and make better
					decisions next. I guess you have even heard "If you aren't
					making any mistakes then you aren't trying anything new" -
					Albert Einstein and "The biggest risk is not taking any risk
					at all" - Mark Zuckerberg. Tony adds us one saying "I
					learned more from my first colossal failure than I ever did
					from my first success" and "if you want to prove yourself,
					to learn as much as you can and do as much as you can, you
					need to put in the time."
				</p>

				<p>
					I would love to complete the is review with this, a direct
					quote from the book. "That’s what you’re looking for when
					you’re young, when you think you know everything then
					suddenly realize you have no idea what you’re doing: a place
					where you can work as hard as you can to learn as much as
					you can your ass, the force of that kick will propel you
					into a new stage of your life. from people who can make
					something great. So even if the experience kicks And you’ll
					figure out what to do next."
