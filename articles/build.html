				<h1>
					Build - An unorthodox Guide to Making things worth Making
					review.
				</h1>

				<p>What is this book?</p>
				<p>
					I started reading this book on my way to the Zebo HQ in
					Adenta in trotro. Most people sitting in Trotro always try
					to kill time by browsing social media. When I try it pisses
					me off because I am constantly reminding I am wasting my
					precious time which actually gets converted to money into
					someone's account.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I try to do something more worthwhile mostly educative
					videos on youtube or read something.
				</p>
				<p>
					Why did I pick this book? Good question, As I time this
					there are over 70 books in a folder on my computer called
					"Self Development" in contains all my non technicals books
					with lessons I wish to learn and improve myself. But one the
					way to the office, I didn't reach out to any of those books.
					I got onto the internet searched Tony Fadell - Build and got
					the book and started reading - Sorry Tony, too broke to buy
					your book now, I promise I will buy a paperback verson
					someday, I promise. I have known about the book for a while,
					now. I think I saw in one Amazon when it lauched two years
					ago. So I knew about it.
				</p>
				<p>
					So I am in the cross roads of potentially joining Zebo,
					might happen, might never happen I don't know. So I thought
					joining a startup being the 3rd* non-national-service
					employee, I need to know more about building. I need to read
					a thing or two on building and out of the whim, I thought
					why not Build? the book's title is literally build.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reaching out for books that I need to learn a thing or two
					has been my thing for a very long time, I don't know how but
					strangely at the some points in time, I just reach out for
					the right book that ends up changing my life.
				</p>
				<p>
					In JHS 2 when I was fed up with school and starting thinking
					certainly there is a way to become successful in life,
					someone brought Rich dad, Poor dad into our class, I glanced
					on it, saw that title and went like this is the book I was
					looking for, it felt like how facebook creepily shows you
					ads based on your google searches except that this was a
					good add that literally changed my life. If I never read
					Rich Poor, Poor Dad within that time of fraustration, I
					would have probably caved to my mum's pressure and gone to
					the University and can you imagine how crazily different a
					life can be in this situation?
				</p>

				<p>
					Aww, snap! Let's go back to build. So yeah, finding myself
					closer and closer to joining a startup - not mine this time
					- a startup founded my people I respect and want to learn
					from - we will come back to this - I needed to read
					something little on Building. But when I picked Build it was
					more like just read a few pages and see what I learn before
					I realized I was in Part IV as I type this. So books are
					just that good, you say oh, lemme see what is inside and you
					lose track of time. That was how I read all of "The
					Psychology of Money" in a weekend.
				</p>

				<p>
					Who is Tony Fadell? So at the Zebo HQ, while I was reading
					this, an intern asked me what the book was about and I said
					it is about building things, it written by a guy called Tony
					Fadell. Do you know Tony Fadell? He said No! and I said He
					helped build the first ipod and also the iphone. If that
					makes you want to read this book then you are in the good
					place if you feel indiferent then you probably shouldn't
					continue reading this. But Tony Fadell is much much more
					that than just that guy, He was at General Magic - They
					failed building the "iPhone" 15 years earlier before the
					world grasped the concept of the iPhone, he built Nest which
					was later bought by Google. You see, I knew all these before
					I picked up the book, these helped in my decision to pick
					the book up when I had the thought. And also, I love
					hardware, got plans of building hardware startups when I
					secure some bag! Oh you don't know General Magic? There is a
					beautiful movie about them see
