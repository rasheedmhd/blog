        <h2>Chapter 1.1 Adulthood</h2>

        <p>
          Simple: Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until
          you learn how to screw up a little bit less. Failure is important
          because sometimes that is the only way you can learn. Fuck around and
          found out, erh?
        </p>
        <p>
          The central theme of this chapter is choosing above everything else,
          trying and failing, learning from the experience and retrying again.
          This is so perfect that if I were to summarise, I would be doing you
          injustice.

            "So when you ‚Äôre looking at the array of potential careers before
            you, the correct place to start is this: ‚ÄúWhat do I want to learn?‚Äù
            Not ‚ÄúHow much money do I want to make?‚Äù Not ‚ÄúWhat title do I want to
            have?‚Äù Not ‚ÄúWhat company has enough name recognition that my mom can
            brutally crush the other moms when they boast about their kids?‚Äù The
            best way to find a job you ‚Äôll love and a career that will
            eventually make you successful is to follow what you ‚Äôre naturally
            interested in, then take risks when choosing where to work. Follow
            your curiosity rather than a business school playbook about how to
            make money . Assume that for much of your twenties your choices will
            not work out and the companies you join or start will likely fail.
            Early adulthood is about watching your dreams go up in flames and
            learning as much as you can from the ashes. Do, fail, learn. The
            rest will follow."

          Which soap do you currently use? I use Santex. Why? because it was my
          mum's favourite and I used it growing up, why change. Which do you use
          and why? Tony talks about how growing up most decisions are made for
          us by our parents and now we have this slight window to make decisions
          for ourselves. Decisions where our lives are at stake and it is a
          small fast moving window in which we must take control and make
          decisions and in this situation we should take risk. If they don't pan
          out good, we can learn and make better decisions next time. To drive
          that point home, Albert Einstein once said "A person who never made a
          mistake never tried anything new" and Mark Zuckerberg also said "The
          biggest risk is not taking any risk at all". Tony adds us one saying
          "I learned more from my first colossal failure than I ever did from my
          first success" and "if you want to prove yourself, to learn as much as
          you can and do as much as you can, you need to put in the time."

          I would love to complete the is review with this, a direct quote from
          the book.

          <p>
            "That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for when you‚Äôre young, when you think
            you know everything then suddenly realize you have no idea what
            you‚Äôre doing: a place where you can work as hard as you can to learn
            as much as you can your ass, the force of that kick will propel you
            into a new stage of your life. from people who can make something
            great. So even if the experience kicks And you‚Äôll figure out what to
            do next."

        <h2>Summary</h2>

          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black"
            >1. School teaches learning wrongly:</span
          >
          The effect is that people that complete school tend to think they are
          done with learning but learning never stops.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black"
            >2. School teaches failure wrongly:</span
          >
          Adulthood is a different kind of school. In Adulthood there are really
          no syllables and no teachers*. Adulthood is the class where you
          develop the courage to do and fail. It is a step you can't dodge
          because there are some lessons that you can only learn through
          failure. You need to embrace failure. Understanding that learning
          doesn't end with school and that there are so many lessons you can
          learn from failure, you get out there, take risk and try things out on
          your own.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black">3. Take risk:</span>
          Prioritise learning over everything in the beginning of your careers
          and that will mean to not focus of branding of the company you want to
          work at or how much they pay you. Focus on working in an environment
          where there is an enormous opportunity to learn.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black">4. Have a goal:</span>
          To strive for something big and hard and important to you. Then every
          step you take toward that goal, even if it‚Äôs a stumble, moves you
          forward.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black">5. Work hard:</span>
          Don't kill yourself for a job but if you want to prove yourself, learn
          as much as you can, you need to put in time. And if you have chosen a
          goal worthwhile chasing it should be fun and worth doing.
        </p>

          <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black"
            >6. Make bold decisions:</span
          >
          At sometime it is going to fall onto to watch straight into your
          future to make the best decisions for your life. Embrace the
          responsibility, take risk and make the best decisions for yourself. It
          is totally okay to ask for advice to make the right decisions.
