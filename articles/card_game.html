        <h1>Life as a Card Game</h1>

        <p>I like to see life as a card game. People come together to play. Only one wins at the end of each game, yet no one is deterred. Players sit, get their cards, and start playing.</p>
      
        <p>Whatever cards you end up getting, it is up to you to win or lose. You might get bad cards or good cards or great cards. Players know this but still sit to play.</p>
      
        <p>Whatever cards you are dealt, you play with those. You win with the cards you are given or lose. Getting good cards doesn't mean you win automaticallyâ€”you still need to play well.</p>
      
        <p>When you get bad cards, it doesn't mean you lose automatically either. You still play and hope to win.</p>
      
        <p>Eventually one wins. But who wins? Why did they win? Maybe luck, or because they are good players, or maybe both.</p>
      
        <blockquote>
          But the most important lesson here is that they play the cards they are dealt. With no complaints, no piss-offs, no sadness, they just play and hope to win.

        <blockquote>
            This is life. Life will deal you bad cards or good cards all the timeâ€”you still need to play the life game.
