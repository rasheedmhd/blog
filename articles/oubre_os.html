				<h1>One does not simply build an Operating System.</h1>

				<p>This is how I built a toy OS in Rust.</p>

				<p>
					I have been programming for years now. I wrote my first code
					in 2016, and believe you me, it was in C++.
				</p>

				<p>
					My first codes were on paper, and the first day I was able
					to key in my hello world C++ code into the PC at the Physics
					lab of my SHS, I knew this was what I wanted to do for life.
					I felt amazed and I wanted to do more.
				</p>

				<p>
					How I got into coding is a little unusual. Back at SHS,
					whenever there was no master in class, I would go to the
					library and read away the minutes while my classmates were
					in class making noise.
				</p>

				<p>
					For as long as I can remember, I have always been intrigued
					by computers ever since I saw them. I don't remember the
					exact year but I think It was around my Primary 6 - 2011.
				</p>

				<p>
					While some of my friends had computers at home, I couldn't
					get my parents to buy me any, the best I could do was to
					worry my dad into paying for me to go learn computing.
				</p>

				<p>
					All I learnt was MS Paint. You see, I just loved computers
					and wanted to be around them. I didn't really learn anything
					aside from drawing a Ghana Flag and making text scroll
					across the screen (marquee) that read “Baba is a computer
					wizard”.
				</p>

				<p>
					The very day, I learnt how to create a marquee, my friends
					came around to the place - it belonged to an ICT teacher of
					our school - I was learning and they saw it, they started
					calling me a computer wizard. I loved it and wanted more.
					That story ends here. I don't remember what happened next. I
					went to JHS.
				</p>

				<p>
					In JHS we had a computer lab and took ICT lessons, nothing
					special learnt throughout the 3 years of JHS. All I remember
					is how we always raced to the ICT lab for lessons because we
					all wanted to spend more time with these godly magical
					machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					Of course ICT was my best subject. You know how most
					programmers tend to be smart kids growing up and doing
					wonderful things with computers? I wasn't like that. Should
					be obvious by now. I was a creative kid, My dad spent some
					time with me helping me to read when I was growing up. I
					loved drawing, and making cars out of tin cans. If I had
					computers to play with, I think the first things I would
					have learnt would have been drawing 2D graphics and
					eventually making car and house plans in 3D before stumbling
					on programming later but that wasn't the case.
				</p>

				<p>
					I never really learnt much after school, I spent a whole lot
					of time alone, making cars and trophies out of tin cans and
					drawing. I was nicknamed “Baba, the drawing master”.
				</p>

				<p>
					I actually won a drawing contest that was organized for the
					whole school when I was in primary 6. It was organized by
					some Arantxa from Spain, we drew a bee, and I got awarded
					with honey.
				</p>

				<p>
					Whew!, I am getting you lost, all I wanted to say was that,
					I wasn't always first in class or really cared about
					position in class, all I cared about was that my position
					was a single and oh! Boy, I was always there on the 9th -
					primary 6 is what I fondly remember.
				</p>

				<p>
					I had a lot of 80-90%'s but I don't remember ever getting
					100%. The highest I ever got was 98% in JHS 3 and guess the
					subject, ICT. What prevented me from getting the 100% was a
					silly mistake. When the master showed me after the paper, I
					wondered how I could make such a silly mistake.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now back to when I was resorting to the library to learn ICT
					books. It was here that I discovered programming.
				</p>

				<p>
					It was here that I realized that oh! software is created
					through a process called programming and at that point I
					knew this was what I wanted to do with my life.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is the book, Discovering Computers that started
					everything. I learnt a lot about computers and tech in
					general and I was hooked. The few things I discovered were
					Windows, Macintosh, Linux, Linus Torvalds, Larry Ellison,
					Oracle, Bill Gates, Intel, PowerPC, Steve Jobs, Steve
					Wozniak, programming and I was hooked. It was like opening a
					door to a magical world of playgrounds for creatives because
					prior to this single book I knew nothing - absolutely
					nothing about tech.
				</p>

				<p>
					On one vacation, I read an article on how 2 Nigerian
					brothers learned how to code from scratch and build a web
					browser that could rival Chrome OS, This is what sparked my
					interest in building an OS, the lessons that I took from
					this that motivated that thought was that
				</p>

				<br />
				<div class="highlight">
					<p>Anyone can learn how to code on their own.</p>
					<p>
						Someone my age actually learned how to code and built
						something useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						And find someone that you can learn and build together.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br />

				<p>
					I was hooked, the only problem, I had no computer. I had no
					mobile phone, the only phone I got was my dad's itel feature
					phone, which I would steal and browse the web with Opera
					Mini basically googling my favorite WWE Wrestle Mania stars.
				</p>

				<p>
					I don't know why it never occurred to me to ask for a
					computer at home. It. It was my dad that knew I loved them
					but I also knew he could not afford one so I never bothered
					to ask him to get me one. Also, you could literally count
					the number of computers in my village at the time with your
					fingers so maybe thinking I could own one for myself isn't
					something that I think my brain could have imagined.
				</p>

				<p>
					My mum could have gotten it for me but I never asked her. I
					don't know why, probably for the same reason above and
					besides I was having a lot of fun building cars with tin
					cans, I wasn't just building, I was selling them as well.
					The trophies I made, I sold them and we would organize
					football leagues with the most exquisite ones. We formed a
					football club that I named “All Stars'' and we were quite
					popular for organizing and winning these leagues. I was
					basically the brain behind “All Stars”, you know the
					creative kid. Whew! We are getting lost again, okay! okay!
					Back! back!
				</p>

				<p>
					Remember 3 above? I reached out to a friend and told him how
					I wanted us to learn how to code and build an operating
					system that would take Microsoft and Apple out of business.
					His mum got him a computer, unlike my family, his mum was an
					educated government worker, working for the NHIS with, you
					guessed it, computers - she still works there as I type this
					today - so she knew the importance of her son having a
					computer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Then we started programming. Batch file viruses, logic
					bombs, and stuff like that. I was the one mostly providing 1
					GHS airtel airtime so that we could subscribe to “Airtel
					Sika Kooko” at the time which would give you 1GB for 24
					hours. We discovered Linux and its variants and that
					programmers used it. We discovered that we could use VMs to
					boot into them or even dual boot on windows. I loved Ubuntu
					and he loved Linux Mint. To get computer time, I would help
					him fill their water pots early so that we could sit and
					code.
				</p>

				<p>
					He couldn't use the computer at night because his mum
					wouldn't agree because it made noise that disturbed her
					sleep. So I would go take the computer and bring it to my
					house and stay awake all night downloading software tools
					and tutorials.
				</p>

				<p>
					But we went to school and that was the end of that dream. I
					kept on programming though.
				</p>

				<p>
					We never really got to study operating systems or even write
					a single line of code because I was still learning and I
					didn't have a computer.
				</p>

				<p>
					So today I am building an operating system - a toy operating
					system. Nothing like what I thought I could build when I was
					growing up. Now I know that such a task is impossible for me
					to pull off but why not build an operating system for the
					fun of it? For the challenge? Shall we? If we magically got
					the chance, why not?
				</p>

				<h2>Credit Leak</h2>

				<p>
					This is how I built Oubre OS. In 2021 during the lockdown I
					was in Kumasi stuck at home. A DevCongress member called Yaw
					- who I would later learn founded DevCongress - posted in
					the general channel that he was in Kumasi and working at the
					“Senior Staff Guest House”. I was at home doing nothing, so
					I immediately replied that I would come around. I took Uber
					(has nothing to do with the OS name) to go meet him. I met
					him, we chatted, he ordered food, and worked a bit and in
					the evening he took me round the school chatting with random
					girls. One conversation that stood out to me was how we both
					admired the craftsmanship of programming and he talked about
					the philosophy of Go. I was intrigued and wanted to learn
					Go. I was shy, and he was initiating me into freely opening
					up conversations with people. I have always struggled with
					that, especially what to say next when you muster the
					courage to say hi, but it all came naturally to Yaw, He
					could present a variant of Yaw to every kind of person and
					actually make them smile and laugh a lot and making people
					happy is something I really admired. Seeing how Yaw did it
					effortlessly I was inspired and well, see me now.
				</p>

				<p>
					After that meeting I tried to meet him that night and the
					next day but failed till he left for Dublin.
				</p>

				<p>
					I have always been interested in understanding the
					fundamentals of computers and programming so that led me to
					wanting to learn and master C. I reached out to yaw on slack
					telling him, That I wanted to learn C, go deeper with the
					Python I know and to also learn Go. That was just it. I
					didn't do any C, Python or Go.
				</p>

				<p>
					At the time I met yaw, I had stopped programming actively
					and when I wanted to come back, I wanted to get a job rather
					than trying to build startups. Amin suggested that I do
					Udacity Nanodegree for the certification since I didn't have
					any qualifications. I bought the course - got into heart
					breaking personal issues - and never finished it. I was
					charged 100$ monthly till I could no longer pay.
				</p>

				<p>
					I reached the APIs module, learnt it and was tasked to build
					an API project to complete the 2nd project of the course. It
					had 3 parts/projects.
				</p>

				<p>
					I built parts of the API but the catch was that the front
					end of the project was written with React and I didn't know
					React.
				</p>

				<p>
					I think it is unfair that the course didn't mention React as
					a prerequisite, and didn't offer React for free but expected
					me to know it before continuing with the project.
				</p>

				<p>
					I set out to use a full month to do React and come back to
					continue the project so I wrote to them asking them to allow
					me to continue the course without the fee or at least with a
					25$/month fee and they said they could only reduce it to 75$
					but that was still high for me so I decided to stop. A
					course that was originally GHS 2,100. I ended up paying over
					GHS 10,000 and they still refused to reduce it to 25$/month
					for me.

				<p>
					And that's how yaw became my mentor and we started the first
					cohort of<a href="toprank.devcongress.org"> Toprank.</a>
				</p>

				<p>Everything moved to discord.</p>

				<p>
					Just like the yaw promised, the breaking ice part of toprank
					was to get us to set up our blogs under our own domain names
					and blogging our progress. The first blog of what was
					supposed to be a public commitment. I set up my website. And
					on 20th November made my public commitment post found here.
					I took a screenshot of it and posted it on my WhatsApp
					status and a friend ridiculed me. Asking what drugs I was
					on, saying that I was going to build an Operating System.
					Right there I knew I had to hold myself accountable to the
					commitment and prove people wrong as well.
				</p>

				<p>
					A few weeks in, my friends dropped out of the project and it
					was left with me alone. And reality dawned on me that, If I
					didn't go out all on this, I was going to eventually give
					up. One thing that kept me going was that I viewed this as
					the biggest chance I have ever had in becoming the sort of
					programmer that I always aspired to become. And I have been
					searching for such an opportunity and never got so I wasn't
					going to f*ck up.
				</p>

				<p>
					It was a do or die for me. It was hard, I was scared, I was
					intimidated. I dreamt several times of being haunted by the
					codes that I was trying to understand. But this was a once
					in a lifetime opportunity and I wasn't willing to let it
					slide away ever.
				</p>

				<p>
					After toiling day and night, reading thousands of pages and
					lines of codes and writing thousands of lines of code I
					finally reached the end of the curriculum.
				</p>

				<h2>Plot twist.</h2>

				<p>
					A few days ago I was bathing and was reminiscing on the UI
					that I drew for the operating system that I wanted to create
					growing up and it hit me that it wasn't an operating system
					that I wanted to build. It was a windowing system. Remember
					I didn't know anything about Operating Systems. I thought
					the OS was the UI but now the OS I wrote doesn't even have a
					windowing system. It simply displays to a VGA Text Buffer.
					That was a settling feeling and realization for me.
				</p>

				<h2>Oubre OS has a Godfather</h2>

				<p>
					If Oubre OS is my child, yaw is Oubre's Godfather. Without
					yaw, there is no Oubre. Starting the story in the early days
					lets you understand that building an OS was just a trivial
					dream like everyone has. But I met yaw, He had intentions
					for TopRank before he ever met anyone called Rasheed. I just
					happened to be blessed with good luck to have met yaw. I got
					an opportunity and took it. The opportunity only came
					because of my love for connecting and learning from people
					smarter than me. When he posted on DevCongress, I could have
					decided not to go and stay home and watch youtube all day.
					But I didn't.
				</p>

				<p>
					Till today, I ask myself why yaw decided to mentor me. Why
					me? But following the story, you realized he was pained by
					my encounter with Udacity. How did I start Udacity in the
					first place? Through Amin's recommendation. At the time I
					wasn't friends with yaw, if I knew yaw and went to him
					saying, hey sir, I want to pay GHS 13,000 to mentor me, he
					would never do it. I probably didn't also have that money
					lying around to pay him, even if I had, I would be too dumb
					to pay him. I would have used it to buy bitcoin. This is a
					story of how we plan and life plans as well. I usually quote
					myself saying “Everyone has plans and life has plans as
					well. And life doesn't give a fuck about our plans”. There
					is a quote that says “Luck is when preparation meets
					opportunity”. All I did was prepare and yaw presented the
					opportunity. Without the opportunity there would be no Oubre
					OS. If yaw didn't add the OS project in TopRank there would
					be no Oubre. I say this because the OS story has brought me
					so far - becoming an all rounded programmer - but the lesson
					isn't that I built an OS. It is all the lessons I learned
					doing toprank and oh! Boy! Oh boy! I learned a lot.
