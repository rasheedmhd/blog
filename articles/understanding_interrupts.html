        <h1>
          An Interrupt-based communication system between a custom hardware
          device and a custom processor.
        </h1>

        <h3>The Device</h3>

        <p>
          We are designing a drone that houses sensors to periodically capture
          arial data and send to our custom designed CPU for processing. Some of
          the data is needed as and when it is captured and some is sent to the
          base for analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the safety of the drone, the most important data that we need to
          capture and process above all, is the data from the proximity sensor.
          The CPU needs this data to calculate the distance of the drone from
          the closest obstacle in real time. The result of this computation is
          then used to steer the drone away from crashing with the obstacle.
        </p>

        <h3>The CPU</h3>

        <p>
          We are designing a power efficient tiny CPU that can fit well into the
          drone chassis. There is the need for it to be well optimised to draw
          the least power usable and also to not heat up during computation. It
          should be resilient in diverse weather conditions by having a robust
          fault tolerance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We need a communication system between the Sensors and the CPU. This
          communication system will serve as the means by which the sensors can
          send the data captured to the CPU for processing. We will design an
          interrupt-based communication system, allowing the sensors to
          communicate with the CPU through
          <a href="interrupts.html" targe="_blank">interrupts</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>The PIC</h3>

        <p>
          The PIC(Programmable Interrupt Controller) is a microchip that enables
          our designed CPU to handle hardware interrupts. Hardware interrupts
          are the way by which our sensors communicate with our CPU.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our PIC chip can be connected with 8 sensors at a time. 1 PIC can be
          connected to another if there is the need for us to use more sensors
          than 8. Below in a diagram showing our sensors connected to the PIC
          which connects to the CPU.
        </p>

        <image alt="Rust String Representation" src="../images/pic.png"></image>

        <p>
          Taking a high level overview of how this system works, Sensors capture
          data and send to the CPU for processing to reorient the drone during
          flight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reason for using this interrupt-based communication system is to
          allow the CPU to do tasks and only attend to the sensors when they
          capture data and want it to process. This gives the illusion of the
          CPU multitasking which saves us a lot of processing power and energy
          as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a sensor wants to send data to the CPU it first sends it to the
          PIC through a data line that connects it to the PIC. The PIC could be
          one or two in this case we use two. We are allowing the PIC to be
          connectable to each other to allow the Drone to use more sensors later
          without a lot of overhead getting it up and running. Letâ€™s call the
          PIC that connects to the CPU as the Primary PIC and the one that
          connects to the Primary PIC as the Secondary PIC. If a sensor connects
          to the PPIC, it sends data to the PPIC which then sends the data
          directly to the CPU. If a sensor is connected to the SPIC, the data is
          relayed by the SPIC to the CPU through the PPIC.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a normal day the sensors send data to the CPU for processing
          through a PICs. On some days where the weather is not so good we can
          have real problems. One of such problems is when interrupts happen so
          often that it becomes impossible to handle them all at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a rainy day, there happens to be a lot of clouds, a lot of change
          in weather and temperature and a lot of turbulence with a lot of
          specks flying around due to the wind. The CPU could easily be
          overwhelmed.
        </p>

        <h3>Buffers</h3>
        <p>
          When the CPU gets overwhelmed with interrupts it sends a stop signal
          to the PIC. The PIC then stops sending new data to the CPU until it
          receives a send signal. While it waits, it will temporarily store all
          new data in a global fixed-size buffer.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the PIC's buffer fills up, it in turn sends a stop signal to the
          sensors. How sensors respond to this signal is described below.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are also going to fit the sensors with a fixed-size buffer too,
          similar to the PIC's. After receiving a stop signal, this is where new
          data will be temporarily stored until the send signal is received.
        </p>

        <h3>Prioritisation</h3>

        <p>
          Inside the PICs, we are going to assign priorities to the sensor data
          in the global buffer. We will be assigning the highest priority to the
          proximity sensor. When the CPU is ready to handle interrupts again,
          the data to first send must be that of the proximity sensorâ€™s.
        </p>

        <h3>Handling Obsolete Data</h3>

        <p>
          Letâ€™s say by the time the CPU is ready to handle interrupts, the
          global buffer is holding several different data from the proximity
          sensor. We already know what data we are getting from the proximity
          sensor and that is the distance. If we have letâ€™s say 7 different data
          points, the first 6 would be obsolete since we need the latest data
          point to work with. We discard the first 6 and only send the 7th
          (last) data point to the CPU for processing.
        </p>

        <h3>Handling buffer overflows</h3>
        <p>
          We need to use a kind of buffer called a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer"
            >Ring/Circular buffer</a
          >. A Ring buffer is a data structure that uses a fixed-sized buffer as
          if it were connected end-to-end. It starts out as an empty buffer.
          When it gets filled with data, the first data that was entered is
          evicted to allow space for the incoming data. This is a property known
          as First-in First-Out(FIFO). It should be noted how this looks similar
          to the implementation above.
        </p>

        <h3>Redundancy</h3>

        <p>
          As a designer of this community protocol it is my hope that the system
          never have to use to the maximum all the buffers and prioritisation in
          the PICs with Sensors at the same time but even if that happens, the
          implementation of the buffers, the prioritisation in the PICs and the
          buffers in the sensors, will ensure that the data from the proximity
          sensor is always received and processed by the CPU to help guide the
          drone to safety.
