				<h1>Notes on Superthinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</h1>

				<h2>Why this Book?</h2>
				<p>
					There are hardly courses on mental models in any school
					curriculum despite they pervasive nature in every day life
					hence it is essential to seek and learn mental models out
					side of school. This books helps you create of over 300
					metal models as your loyal soldiers always ready to get
					ready for action to help you reason with situation.
					Surprises, Risk, Decisions etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					I got to know of this book through my mentor yaw - add
					bluesky link - It was one of our sessions of TopRank. I was
					explaining to yaw how at some point, I decided to think the
					opposite of what every one was thinking. An example would
					be, you see those situations where a solution is needed and
					people are called in to solve it? So if this person fails,
					the next person gets called to "try your luck". Through
					observation - thanks to reading Sherlock Holmes (write about
					this later)- I realized that my peers would usually do the
					same damn thing or a very slightly tweaked variant of what
					the person prior did. Taking a lesson from Albert Eisntein
					when he said "You can't solve a problem when the same
					mindset that created it" - get the exact quote -, I decided
					to always go a 180 degree angle and approach the problem
					from there. As a "technique that I devised to help me solve
					problems", I admit that I haven't used it as much as I would
					have loved to, that is not to say it is not effective
					because I have been surprised several times by how it
					actually helped me solve real problems so I have always kept
					it dear to my heart and that is how come I was explaining it
					to yaw. Yaw gave me a refinement me of the Idea and infact
					he told me it had a name and that it was called lateral
					thinking and it fell under a broader category called Mental
					Models. He recommended this book for me to read. This was 2
					years ago but I am now reading now - there is always so much
					to read - and I hope to add the over 300 mental models in
					this book to my toolbox, just like I knew lateral thinking
					without even knowing its name, there are other mental models
					that the book talks about that I am familiar with but
					regardless I hope to learn more about them.
				</p>

				<h2>What are Mental Models?</h2>
				<p>
					They are reccurring themes/ideas across several disparate
					subjects thet gives you an insight into better
					understanding, explaining, predicting a situation. There are
					like fundamental truths that appear in several disparate
					subjects. Once you are familiar with them, you can use them
					to create a mental picture of a situation to help you reason
					on how deal with the situation.
				</p>

				<h2>What is Superthinking?</h2>
				<p>
					Even though Metal Models can be fundamental reasonings
					across disparate subjects, They often originate from
					specific disciplines like Physics, Computer Science or
					Psychology etc. Amongst these mental models, there are some
					that are wildly useful across several other disciplines.
					Understanding them gives you a leg up in developing
					understanding across disparate disciplines. These very
					wildly-applicable-to-wildly-varied disciplines are called
					super models. Using these regularly is termed as
					superthinking, the ability to think about the world better.
					Now that you know about Mental Models, Super Models and the
					super power that they give you - superthinking, I encourage
					you to learn them, regularly apply them to make better
					decisions.
				</p>

				<h2>Summary</h2>

				<p>
					1. Super models are a shortcut to higher-level thinking:
					like knowing multiplication and using it instead of using
					addition only to achieve multiplication, because you only
					know about addition.
				</p>
				<p>
					2. You need to know Super models well enough so you can
					develop an intuition on where and when to use them
					effectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					3. Super models are a toolbox to have. You need to learn to
					use the right tool for the right situation and to be able to
					do that, you kinda need to have a toolbox full of
					tools(super models), right? yeah, right.
				</p>
				<p>
					4. Super models help you not use what you know to try to
					solve everything. Maslow's hammer.
				</p>
				<p>
					5. Knowing super models in like having your first super
					powers like a hero, you need to learn to master super models
					and that will make you a super hero then.
				</p>
				<p>6. Apply inverse/lateral thinking to be wrong less.</p>
				<p>
					7. Study and seek out unforced errors in your life and weed
					them out.
				</p>
				<p>
					8. Antifragile - get better, like they say what doesn't kill
					you makes you stronger - If your thinking is antifragile,
					then it gets better over time as you learn from your
					mistakes and interact with your surroundings
				</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<div class="highlight">
					<p>
						"Learning to apply super mental models in this manner
						doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. Like Spider-Man or the Hulk,
						you won‚Äôt have instant mastery of your powers. The
						superpowers you gain from your initial knowledge of
						these mental models must be developed. Reading this book
						for the first time is like Spider-Man getting his spider
						bite or the Hulk his radiation dose. After the initial
						transformation, you must develop your powers through
						repeated practice. When your powers are honed, you will
						be like the Hulk in the iconic scene from the movie The
						- link to scene - When Captain America wants Bruce
						Banner (the Hulk‚Äôs alter ego) to turn into the Hulk, he
						tells him, ‚ÄúNow might be a really good time for you to
						get angry.‚Äù Banner replies, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my secret, Captain.
						. . . I‚Äôm always angry.‚Äù - Superthinking
