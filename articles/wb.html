        <h1>A deep dive into explaining Technical Woocho-Boocho (Jargons)</h1>

        <p>
          What is Woocho-Boocho? Well it is a made up word. I just made it up.
          So letâ€™s give it a meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Woocho-Boocho means a technical word in computer programming. A
          technical word refers to something that you will see programmers throw
          around from time to time in their conversations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started learning how to build programming languages and I am going
          to take you throw the things that I learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things I have heard prior without knowing their meanings and things
          that I am learning about for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>This should be fun trust me.</p>
        <p>
          A series of articles where I explain technical words common in
          programming language design
