        <h1>I No Longer Want to Be Richer Than Bill Gates</h1>

        <p>That is not a click bait. When I was in high school I somehow believed I could be richer than Bill Gates. Bill was the richest man in the world at the time.</p>
      
        <p>And all my life I had known Bill as the richest man alive. And it seemed everyone knew that. I mean you could ask anyone and they could easily tell you who the richest man alive was.</p>
      
        <p>But since then ‚Äî 2016/17 ‚Äî a lot more people have held that title: Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and now Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH as I type this. [edit: 2025 as I as I publish this, Elon Musk is the richest man alive] So the richest man is no longer easy to tell [edit: 2025: of course it is, if you know where to look], but I kid you not that others would still think it is Bill Gates.</p>
      
        <p>Why did a Ghanaian teenager from the remotest part of the country think he could be richer than Bill Gates? I don't know for sure. Maybe blame it on <em>The Power of the Subconscious Mind</em> by Claude M. Bristol.</p>
      
        <p>At the time people called me weird. I don't know why. I was sort of ousted. People wouldn't want to take me seriously or agree with what I said. To them, I said so many weird things that they concluded I was weird. I was considered different, and I embraced it. It's not like I had a choice. I still do so many things today because of that experience. When everyone is going left, it is sure that you will see me going right. I strive to not conform.</p>
      
        <p>When I read the book mentioned above, it made a lot of sense to me. I could be anything I wanted. All I had to do was think it and believe it ‚Äî believe it so much without having the lightest strand of a doubt. I don't know why, but I did believe I could be bigger than Bill Gates. But well, money is a great motivation ‚Äî who wouldn't want to have it, and more and more of it?</p>
      
        <p>And I had the strongest belief that it would happen. I used to fight with my friend Rafiu on that. He thought I was crazy, unrealistic, and dreaming. He asked me to wake up, and I thought he was a bad friend for not believing in me. To me, he was a bad influence.</p>
      
        <p>As the years went by, I started relenting on my beliefs. Reality hit me, and I realised that being richer than Bill Gates was not going to be that easy ‚Äî even though I can still see a scenario where that could happen.</p>
      
        <p>Jim and Bill's childhood prepared them for that, while mine didn't. And my mom's dream (teacher/bank manager) ‚Äî ironically ‚Äî it prepared me entrepreneurship.</p>
      
        <p>I move to the USA. Join a space asteroid mining company as a software engineer, work myself to the top. One day we mine a trillion-dollar asteroid. Easy peasy.</p>
      
        <p>This is just to tell you that if I really wanted, I could still continue to believe with the strongest conviction that I could become richer than Bill Gates and worked incredibly hard towards making that happen and with a loooootttttaaaaa luck make it happen. It doesn't matter to me if you say that just because I believe I can make it happen, doesn't mean it will happen. I know if I do, it will happen. At least Elon Musk taught me that.</p>
      
        <p>But I am choosing not to go that route any longer. I don't want to be richer than Bill Gates ‚Äî I want to be happy.</p>
      
        <p>If anything, I want to be like Jamie Dimon. I want to have a huge impact on the world. I was watching an interview of Jamie Dimon by Bloomberg, and he mentioned how his company moves 10 trillion dollars across the world daily. I quickly googled his net worth ‚Äî and he was worth about 1.9 billion dollars. And I thought, he doesnt' have to be stupid rich, he is okay with the impact he is making. He is happy with his life. And I want to be like that. He is a family man. This is a great way to live.</p>

        <p>Bill Gates talks bout the same thing on creating incredibly value in the world and capturing a tiny fraction of that value. When describing what a platform is. I think everyone's like is a platform.</p>

        <div class="quote">
          A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.

        <p>Prior to this revelation, he talks about how he is a family man. And when I said I want to be happy ‚Äî family is where I want to be happiest most. To quote Jamie Dimon:</p>
      
        <div class="quote">‚ÄúObviously my family comes first.‚Äù</div>
      
        <p>Second, have a huge impact on the world. I want to inspire, nurture people to build billion-dollar companies solving Africa's biggest problems. Making life better. If I can trade that with a billion dollars, a trillion dollars, I would.</p>
      
        <p>I want to be like Jamie Dimon ‚Äî have a happy family and have the biggest impact on the world that I can ever make.</p>
      
        <p><strong>So help me Allah.</strong></p>
