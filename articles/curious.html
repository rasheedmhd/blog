        <h1>Infinitely Curious</h1>

        <p>If I looked at myself like a super hero,
my super powers would be that I am infinitely curious
in intellectually stimulating knowledge. I am super
curious on knowing how things work, how they were built.</p>
<p>1. Knowing satifies my curiosity which can be very strong
and demanding. but I don't think satifying the curiosity is enough.</p>
<p>2. Once I know how they were built, how they work, the next thing
is that it grows my knowledgebase in understanding the world, how
to live in it, how to be inspired by it and how to appreciate it.</p>

<p>3. The next step is that my knowledgebase serve as a pool of resourceful
ideas for me to rely on when I am creating anything.
There are very few fundamental ideas that cuts across in so many aspects
fo life. My strength or my utility of my knowledgebase is picking
seemingly random unrelated things to the average person and identifying
fundamental cross-cutting patterns and ideas combining them to create
something novel and brilliant.</p>

<p>4. I am infinitly curious but not in everything subject. Obviously
there are subjects that bore me to death. They are other subjects that
pumps my brain with caffeine and keeps it lit for like forever, chases
sleep away and just lets me dig deeper.</p>

<p>5. My current obsession is everything computers. And I find that by an extension,
    I am obsessed with what powers the 21st century. Code and Computers. I have so many other
    curiosities like video production, space travel, building businesses, venture capital, I am
    excited about all these because it means there will always be something for me to learn.
    I believe as time goes by I might lose interest in some things or just know enough of something
    that I feel like it is the right time to pursue a different topic. But whatever happens I have an 
    endless supply of interesting things to keep pursuing. ?c
</p>
<p>6. If there is anything that I want to pursue forever, it will be
pursuing knowledge. There is so much beauty in knowing things.</p>
<p>7. I wish that I leave this earth, I will be pursuing knowledge.
In other ways I was to pursue knowledge till I die.</p>
